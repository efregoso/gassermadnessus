      <p><b>I miss you, Scotty</b></p>
      <p>One of the last conversations I had with Scotty was about our blog. 
      With that undeniable grin of his on his face, he walked up to me in 
      Englishtown and said, “So, Toddly, what’s up with the blog? Didn’t you 
      make out a schedule at the beginning of season?” I said yes and reminded 
      him that he had dodged his blogging responsibilities as well because his 
      name is on the schedule. He just continued to grin and told me he would 
      write something soon.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      I’ve been thinking about this entry for a couple of days and still don’t 
      know exactly what to type. I try very hard not to make these blogs about 
      me, but right now I am being a tad selfish, and I’m not sure how this is 
      going to come across because I’m still very raw with emotions, and I miss 
      my friend more and more as each minute passes. I may ramble around in this 
      and not write like I need to, but please excuse me if I do. My good 
      friend, Phil Burgess, asked me yesterday when I was going to write a blog 
      and even gave me some suggestions, but I think I’m just gonna shoot from 
      the hip here because I know Scotty would appreciate that.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Scotty was a giant to me. We teased him and called him “stumpy” sometimes 
      because of his stature, but always in my mind he was Superman … and he 
      still is. He was one of the most genuine people I have ever met. He told 
      you how he felt no matter the consequences. He knew what he said may not 
      be pleasant sometimes for you to hear, but he said it anyway and meant 
      every word. I admired that most about him. My good friend, Bob Wilber, 
      once offered me this simple line of advice – Say what you mean and mean 
      what you say. I always think of Scotty when I remind myself of Bob’s 
      words. Bob and I were talking about a Rush concert when Scotty made his 
      last lap. I remember every second of it. We were standing side-by-side in 
      the press room in E-town watching the run after we finished our chat about 
      Rush and Bob was nudging me and saying that’s a good lap and that’ll get 
      you in. Then, the explosion … and I instantly turned to watch the monitor 
      in the press room and everything since then has been a blur. The images on 
      the screen will never leave my head. I have been fighting to keep them 
      away, but I’m not sure if I need to. In a way, I almost need them there to 
      cope because the last time I saw my friend he was doing what he did best: 
      driving a race car with all his might.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      We are all going through the stages. I have still not passed through 
      denial and anger. I’m mad as hell that Scotty is dead. I have cussed aloud 
      at him, God, drag racing, and myself. I know there are a lot of people on 
      our team who are doing the same thing, but I think we have to do those 
      things to become stronger. The anger will pass and the denial will, too, 
      but I still keep watching the pit area waiting for him to come around the 
      corner of the race rig and wake up from this nightmare, but I know that is 
      not going to happen and no tribute decal or t-shirt or anything is going 
      to bring Scotty back to us. I hope someday soon that I can get to a point 
      of grieving, but I’m not there yet.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Scotty touched so many peoples’ lives. I guess I knew that before he died, 
      but it was not as apparent to me as it has been in this past week. More 
      than 5,000 people have sent e-mail condolences and that’s only a fraction 
      of the calls and text messages and all sorts of things that all of us have 
      been getting. I want to take this opportunity to thank you all for being 
      there for us when we need you most. <br>
      <br>
      I also want to say thank you to a few people in particular who you all 
      need to know have been the only way I have been able to get through this 
      so far. Phil Burgess was the first person I called after we found out that 
      Scotty passed. He coached me and guided me as a peer but with the care of 
      a friend, and I will never be able to thank him enough. Dave Densmore and 
      Elon Werner, the PR powerhouse at John Force Racing, have been rock-solid 
      brothers to me, offering advice and giving me two big shoulders to cry on 
      in those first few terrible hours. Thanks guys, love you. My best bud, 
      Lisa Powers, who you all know from the Herbert camp, has been the best 
      friend I could have. I haven’t leaned on her too much because I have a 
      hard time letting things go, but she has been there for me with every 
      phone call and late-night texts. She knows me well enough to not try to 
      make me let things out right now and for that I am most thankful to her. 
      Everyone in our little drag racing world has been tremendous, so on behalf 
      of Kalitta Motorsports, thanks to all of you who have expressed your 
      condolences and support and prayers. We are truly blessed to know you all.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The world will never be the same without Scott Kalitta. I will cherish 
      every memory I have of him … good and bad. I could keep rambling here for 
      days, and I may again soon, but for now, I’ve said all I can say.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      I miss you, Scotty. You were never just my driver. You were always my 
      friend. Thank you, bud. I hope you and Eric are having some great match 
      races up there.<br>
