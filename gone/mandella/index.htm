        <p align="justify"><b>Most of you probably didn't know him, but Ron 
        Mandella passed away April 2nd, 2007 at age 67 from a very aggressive 
        form of brain cancer discovered only last August.&nbsp; <br>
        I first met Ron when he was working in his parent's florist shop in 
        Temple City, CA.&nbsp; He occasionally even made deliveries in his 426 Max 
        Wedge powered 63 Plymouth Wagon (prominently sponsored by Reynold's Auto 
        Supply, also of Temple City.)&nbsp; He was runner-up in A/SA at the Nationals 
        in 1963 and with a new sponsor and the car no longer street-driven, 
        managed to win the class at Indy in 1964.&nbsp; He was later involved with 
        the Shores &amp; Hess A/GS Anglia; in fact, when S&amp;H put first the blown Rat 
        Motor in their Anglia, it was actually from Ron's sand dragster while 
        their engine was being built by Jack Bayer. Ron was a few years older 
        than me and it wasn't like we were close buddies, but I do remember him 
        well and he was a good guy...at least he always treated me well.&nbsp; 
        Ron also occasionally drove the Anglia.&nbsp; In 1967, when S &amp; H split and 
        Jim Shores took the car east, Ron went with him and handled the driving 
        duties while they were on tour. <br>
        Ron and his wife Debbie were together 40 years until his death.<br>
        You were a good man, Ron, and you'll be missed. </b></p>
