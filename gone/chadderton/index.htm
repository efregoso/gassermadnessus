      <b><font size="2">Courtesy of Phil Burgess.&nbsp; First published on 
      NHRA.com</font></b><p><b>Former fuel altered, Funny Car driver Chadderton 
      dies:</b> Leroy Chadderton, a well-known Southern California-based driver 
      of fuel altereds and Funny Cars in the 1970s, died April 3 after a long 
      battle with cancer and heart problems. </p>
      <p>Chadderton wheeled, among his many rides, the Magnificent 7 and B&amp;M 
      Speed Center fuel altereds and the Hawaiian Funny Car.</p>
      <p>Chadderton began racing at Colton Dragstrip in Southern California in 
      1958 with a D/Gas ’55 Chevy and later a Ford Model A, which later ran 
      injected on nitro.<FONT SIZE="7"><img src="chad2.jpg" border="1" style="float: right" width="400" height="321"></FONT></p>
      <p>His first fuel altered, built with Al Hawkins, was a 354 
      Chrysler-powered Woody Gilmore-built ’23-T that he first campaigned in 
      1965. This car later became the Magnificent 7 car, so named because of the 
      team’s quest to become the first in the seven-second zone. Chadderton 
      achieved that goal in 1966 with a 7.96 at Lions Drag Strip and in 1969 
      became the first to record a six-second time in a fuel altered, a 6.89 in 
      Saginaw, Mich.</p>
      <p>Chadderton was part of a fuel altered tour through the late 1960s and 
      early 1970s that also included Willie Borsch and Leon Fitzgerald.<br>
      <br>
      Chadderton became the latest in a string of pilots in Roland Leong’s 
      Hawaiian Funny Cars in 1972 following the departure of Bobby Rowe. The 
      team set the NHRA national record for a short time at 6.66 and won the 
      prestigious <i>Popular Hot Rodding</i> event. His ride in the Hawaiian 
      ended when the entire operation was stolen from a hotel parking lot 
      outside of Gary, Ind., and Leong did not have the funds to immediately 
      replace it. <br>
      <br>
      Chadderton joined forces with Glen Okazaki in 1974 for a short-lived run 
      with a Vega Funny Car before it was parked. Chadderton, Okazaki, and Mikio 
      Yoshioka opened Precision Products in Pomona, Calif., which later became 
      Performance Machine.</td>
