      <span style="font-weight:normal">Hotrodding and racing lost one of its 
      luminaries this past weekend when John&nbsp; Buttera passed away from 
      complications of a brain</span><span style="font-weight:normal"> tumor.&nbsp; 
      “Lil John”, as he was known to the industry, was 67 at the time of his

      <span style="font-weight:normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Buttera loved the California 
      lifestyle, especially racing and rodding aspects of being in the Golden
      </span><span style="font-weight:
  normal">State</span><span style="font-weight:
normal">, but unlike many of its pioneers, he was not a native.&nbsp; Buttera came to 
      “The Coast” in 1969 with a reputation and tremendous skills already intact 
      when he abandoned the snow and ice of </span>
      <span style="font-weight:normal">Wisconsin for SoCal’s balmy beaches.&nbsp; It 
      was in Kenosha</span><span style="font-weight:
 normal">, </span><span style="font-weight:normal">Wisconsin that Buttera built 
      a reputation for designing, fabricating and welding highly crafted 
      dragster chassis as the “B” part of R&amp;B Chassis.&nbsp; R&amp;B built many of the 
      upper Midwest’s best cars, and his skills as a high-end craftsman made it 
      possible for him to smoothly transition his way into the ranks of “chassis 
      masters” on the SoCal scene.</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:200%" align="justify">
      <span style="font-weight:normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His initial works were in 
      building more front-engine dragsters, but he soon branched into Funny Cars 
      and then Pro Stocks, each one bearing notably innovative design and 
      flawless craftsmanship.&nbsp; Soon “Lil John Race Cars” became a hallmark among 
      many of the top drag racers of the 70’s.&nbsp; Among his very well known 
      customers were Don “Snake” Prudhomme and Don “Stardust” Schumacher.&nbsp; It 
      was also Buttera who designed and built the very successful and unique 
      Barry Setzer owned, Bruce Walker driven, small-block Chevy powered Pro 
      Stock Vega of the early 70’s, one of the most successful Pro cars run on 
      the West Coast.</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:200%" align="justify">
      <span style="font-weight:normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Buttera was gifted not only 
      as a fabricator and welder but also as a machinist. All of his works were 
      adorned with examples of his rampantly intuitive creativity.&nbsp; He may very 
      well have been the “father of billet components” in racing and street 
      rodding, as his love of taking a chunk of aluminum and machining it into 
      something uniquely functional were legend.&nbsp; Buttera caught the street rod 
      bug in the 70’s, and created several top-flight rods.&nbsp; These were not only 
      rolling examples of his talent, but high mileage rides that he was quick 
      to jump into and drive hundreds of miles purely for the pleasure of 
      enjoying driving a car that was his own creation.&nbsp; </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:200%" align="justify">
      <span style="font-weight:normal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A true hot rodder and lover 
      of anything that had wheels and went fast, Buttera proved that even a 
      little guy without huge corporate sponsorships could, with plenty of hard 
      work, ingenuity and dedication, build a race car capable of qualifying for 
      and running in the 1987 Indy 500.&nbsp; Buttera’s dream began with a cast-off 
      Dan Gurney Eagle chassis tub which Buttera re-engineered, redesigned and 
      rebuilt, ending up with a virtual masterpiece that had even veteran Indy 
      campaigners admiring what one optimist from the hot rodding culture could 
      produce.&nbsp; Buttera’s car didn’t win Indy, but it qualified eighth, a third 
      row position that was substantially ahead of a field filled with cars and 
      crews backed by at least ten times the cash resources Buttera had in his 
      jeans.&nbsp; It was the same optimistic “Hey, we can do that deal!”, never 
      stymied attitude that earmarked Buttera’s craft and his life.</span></p>
