		of drag racing lost another good man. Frank Cali passed away on April 
		16, 2008. Frank was born on September 9, 1943 on Long Island New York 
		and began his life long love of cars. Not only was he a nice guy, but a 
		fix-anything-hands-on mechanic. He later developed welding and 
		fabrication skills that produced many one-off custom street cars and 
		notable track cars. Beginning in the early 60’s Frank and his brother 
		John began collecting cars, fixing them up and were often firsts in the 
		neighborhood to hand build many fast hot rods that terrorized the 
		streets of</b><FONT SIZE="7"><b><img border="0" src="FrankCali4.jpg" width="350" height="345" align="right" style="border-style: double; border-width: 3px" hspace="5" vspace="3"></b></FONT><b> 
		Queens. Frank always wore a smile and had something comical to say 
		expressing it with his heavy Brooklyn accent…”fa-get-a-bout-it!”. John 
		was the quiet bad boy type that everyone liked; together they were 
		always involved in neighborhood antics. In the mid 60’s Frank and John 
		operated a gas station in Queens and inside Frank spent countless hours 
		hand crafting their “Cali Brothers” Chevy powered little red Anglia. You 
		could not help but be in awe of Frank’s self taught fabrication skills 
		and sometimes doing it on his back clearing away snow so he could weld 
		underneath the car while others would just wait till Spring, not Frank. 
		Frank proudly wore the Jack Merkel Racing logo on that little red Anglia 
		and teamed up with fellow friends and racers Pat Di Stefano,
		<a href="../kobel/index.htm">Ray Kobel</a>’s 40 Willys Coupe, Willy Feyh 
		and Dave Daly’s MG, Vinny Tarentola’s 41 Willys and Jack Merkel’s 33 
		Willys. Frank raced all over the East Coast, from Connecticut Raceway, 
		Dover Drag way, English Town, Island Drag Way, Islip and even to Indy 
		setting many NHRA records of the day…. classic gassers at their best.
		<br>
		Later in life Frank relocated to upstate New York and kept at his love 
		of cars by buying, fixing and reselling cars and also working on his 
		classic Caddy with air ride for his street cruiser. Frank also turned 
		his creative skills to hand crafting stained glass and many works of 
		art. <br>
		Frank lost his brother John whom he so loved, but still continued at his 
		love for cars by keeping in contact with his old gasser buddies at the 
		annual Queens neighborhood reunions each year. Please join us in 
		remembering Frank Cali. <br>
		Remembered by friends Les Cobb of California, Pat Di Stefano and Dave 
		Daly of New York.</b></p>
