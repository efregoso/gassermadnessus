      Daniels - and of course Eileen - was a major influence on NHRA drag racing 
      in the Midwest, the East Coast, and at the national level as well.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      For many years Bob was the controlling force of NHRA's major event staging 
      and organizing operations, manning &quot;Monitor&quot; and barking commands across 
      the pits and staging lanes of The Nationals and Winternationals. Bob's 
      sometimes brusquely delivered &quot;orders&quot; were something he came by 
      naturally, as a former U.S. Navy Chief Petty Officer.<br>
      <br>
      Bob's naval career is often overlooked because it was a part of his life 
      that most knew little of. Bob never left his Navy service too far in his 
      wake. Many years later, he made a sizeable impact on the creation of the 
      permanently moored, U.S.S. Salem, CA-139, a WW-2/Korea era heavy cruiser 
      as a memorial museum. Bob worked quietly yet tirelessly on this project 
      for several years, first securing release of the ship from the waiting 
      torches of the ship breakers to gaining the confidence and support of city 
      fathers to secure a permanent site (Quincy, MA) for the ship. At the same 
      time he made significant contributions of his time and efforts in 
      organizing the reunions for those who served on The Salem.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="justify">After he left his post as NHRA Division III Director he 
      assumed the operational role at NHRA's premier racing facility, 
      Indianapolis Raceway Park. He and Eileen (she was at his side all the way, 
      right up to the end) moved from Ohio to Indy, where they re-made that 
      already great facility into
      the crown jewel of NHRA's track properties, ultimately making the drag 
      strip and IRP circle track the best of the best.<br>
      <br>
      After Bob and Eileen retired from the IRP post they worked with Steve 
      Gibbs and Wally Parks to create the Wally Parks-NHRA Motorsports Museum, 
      at the Fairgrounds, in Pomona. Eileen also oversaw the hospitality 
      functions at NHRA's various track properties.<br>
      <br>
      These are just a handful of the achievements that Bob Daniels leaves as 
      his legacy. There are many, many more I know I've overlooked in this brief 
      sketch.<br>
      <br>
      Bob had been fighting serious illness for several years, but he still 
      managed to play a major part in the creation and operations of the 
      National Hot Rod Reunion, of late at Bowling Green, KY's Beech Bend Park, 
      and most recently at National Trail Raceway. This year's NHRR, the first 
      ever at National Trail Raceway, was The Old Chief's last drag race. May he 
      rest in peace.<br>
