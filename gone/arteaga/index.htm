      I 
      can't say that I knew Wayne very well.&nbsp; We never</b><FONT SIZE="7"><b><img border="0" src="Wayne-Potvin.jpg" width="400" height="323" align="right" hspace="7" vspace="5"></b></FONT><b>
      met face-to-face, 
      but emailed a few times and spoke on the phone</b><b> several times.&nbsp; 
      What I can tell you about him is that he was very friendly and generous 
      with the fruits of his labors.&nbsp; I</b><b> do know a number of people 
      who knew Wayne well and all of them have nothing but good things to say 
      about him!</b></p>

      <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify"><b>When I 
      mentioned that he was generous with the fruits of his labors, here's what 
      I wrote around 2002 for the <i><a target="_self" href="../../arteaga">
      <font color="#808000">Photos by Wayne Arteaga</font></a></i> page on this 
      website:</b></p>
      <p align="justify">&quot;I called Wayne a couple of months ago to ask if he 
      would share some of his photos with the visitors to this website. Wayne 
      hadn't seen the site before, so I asked him to take a look around and then 
      let me know if he was interested in contributing some photos.&nbsp; About a 
      month or so later, having heard nothing from him, I was shocked to receive 
      a package via UPS with 70+, 8x10 photos in it!&quot;</p>
      <p align="justify"><b>It seems that that's the kind of guy he was.&nbsp; 
      On more than one occasion, he also supplied photos for people who wanted 
      to build models of his old cars.&nbsp; One example is on the<i><font color="#808000">

      Arteaga's Henry J</font></a><font color="#808000"> </font></i>page.&nbsp; 
      For a guy who made his living selling his photography, those were very 
      generous gestures!</b></p>

      far as Wayne's racing history goes, he started in the early fifties and 
      was still turning a tire or two well into the nineties!&nbsp; It included 
      a couple of well-known cars like his Potvin-blown Henry J and, later, the

      <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="justify"><b>On top of 
      that, his place was also sort of a &quot;Midwest Pit Stop&quot; for many of the

      Cook, etc. used Wayne's place as sort of a home away from home when they
