        <p align="justify">Rarely in life do you have the good fortune to meet 
        an individual who's well-known in his field yet wonderfully accessible, 
        down-to-earth and just plain enjoyable to be around. Such was the case 
        with Pat Foster.</p>
        <p align="justify">Foster, who passed away from medical complications 
        March 28, was indeed one of those types. Known as either &quot;Uncle Patty&quot; 
        or simply &quot;Foster&quot;, he never knew a stranger. Whether you knew Pat from 
        &quot;way back&quot;, or had just met him, the result was the same. Foster 
        immediately made anyone feel as if they'd known him forever.</p>
        <p align="justify">Foster's credentials in drag racing were second to 
        none. He began his career in the sport like many other youngsters, 
        hanging around, first watching and then helping a neighborhood racer 
        work to prepare his hot rod for the weekend's race. In Foster's case it 
        was the very talented and dedicated Ron Scrima who took the time to 
        steer the young lad in the right direction. As the cliche goes, &quot;the 
        rest is history&quot;.</p>
        <p align="justify">After serving as a tire-wiper and crewman, Foster got 
        the nod to make a pass in Rocky Childs' Chevy powered AA/FD. He took to 
        the job like a trout jumping into a mountain stream, and in his lifetime 
        Foster claims he drove as many as 50 different race cars. He even 
        compiled a lengthy list from memory, and said he was sure there were 
        others he'd forgotten.</p>
        <p align="justify">His driving skills were huge. He was equally at home 
        in a front motor Top Fuel Dragster or the closed confines of a nitro 
        Funny Car. He survived several spectacular crashes, one of which nearly 
        cost him his life and required over a year of recovery time. Each time 
        he bounced back, better and more competitive than ever.</p>
        <p align="justify">My path's first crossing with Pat Foster came about 
        somewhat indirectly in June, 1969. The race was the NHRA Springnationals, 
        then hosted by the brand new Dallas International Motor Speedway. Foster 
        had been working for Mickey Thompson as a car builder, fabricated and 
        welded a major portion of Mickey's two new, Ford sponsored Mustang Mach 
        1 Funny Cars. Both were powered by blown Ford 427 SOHC motors and fueled 
        by a generous Ford budget. The &quot;Red Car&quot; was driven by Foster, the &quot;Blue 
        Car&quot; by Danny Ongais and either car very capable of Low ET and Top Speed 
        performances.</p>
        <p align="justify">On a qualifying run Foster collided with Gerry 
        Schwartz, a relatively new Funny Car racer from Fort Wayne, Indiana. The 
        well-liked Schwartz had assembled a Logghe chassis and a nitro burning 
        big-block Chevy and was trying to make the Springnationals his 
        breakthrough event. The car was once the Logghe &quot;house car&quot;, mounting a 
        Cougar body and powered by an SOHC Ford. Now with the Chevy it was 
        called the &quot;Ratty Cat&quot;. Although not as well known as the team of Foster 
        and Ongais, Schwartz and his car had the ability to make the show and go 
        rounds.</p>
        <p align="justify">Conflicting stories have since been told, but the two 
        cars collided in a frightful, screeching, grinding crash. Schwartz's 
        Cougar did several violent rollovers atop the Armco guardrail with dust 
        and debris raining across a wide area. I was on the pit side of the 
        track and had walked over to the fence to watch the fuel cars make their 
        runs. In the resulting melee the engine in Schwartz's high-gear only car 
        went sky-high, exploding and tossing its clutch, flywheel, floater discs 
        and other components. Pieces came slashing towards my location and as I 
        tried to run to safety, I suddenly realized that the shrapnel was much 
        faster than my feet. The pieces kissed and landed in the pits, striking 
        several cars but injuring no one in the pit area.</p>
        <p align="justify">Across the track the crash was as bad as it looked. 
        Both cars were destroyed, the damage to Schwartz's car obviously the 
        worst. Foster had injuries, but the innovative roll cage design of the 
        new M/T car kept Foster from more serious peril. Schwartz's older car 
        didn't have that advantage. The steel guardrail acted like a vicious 
        buzz saw and Gerry Schwartz perished from massive head injuries 
        sustained in the crash.</p>
        <p align="justify">Many years later, after I had become friends with 
        Pat, I told him I had been there, and I related my own recollections of 
        that day and its aftermath. Foster's face grew dark. It was obvious that 
        this was a memory maybe best left unvisited. After a few seconds to 
        gather his composure he told me the whole story of that day and the run, 
        and how much he regretted its results.</p>
        <p align="justify">Pat Foster was like that, always quick to relate a 
        humorous story from the old days or to explain what happened and how he 
        handled another. When the story related to one of the tragedies in his 
        life he never ducked the punch, but stepped up and told it the best way 
        he knew, honestly and factually. It's impossible not to admire someone 
        with that type of personal ethical character.</p>
        <p align="justify">Foster's hands-on skills with a wrench, a welder or a 
        butterfly steering wheel brought him many honors and success. He drove 
        front-motor dragsters when these cars were the ultimate source of driver 
        peril, either from crashes, smoking hot parts tossed back in a driver's 
        face, or worse, when searing flames ate their way through the improved 
        yet still inadequate firesuits, gloves and masks and torched raw flesh. 
        He drove those cars - in many different configurations and 
        conflagrations, for many different car owners - and survived to race 
        another day.</p>
        <p align="justify">In the early 1970's double-knit, synthetic fabrics 
        were all the fashion rage. One young man, Barry Setzer, had Carolina 
        mills working round the clock to meet the demand. His fortune was 
        enormous, and he loved drag racing. Setzer assembled a top-flight Funny 
        Car and an unlimited supply of blown, nitro burning, 426 Hemi engines 
        from Ed Pink's power palace. Wisely, he hired Foster for the driving 
        chores and for his skills with wrenches and a welder. He was the 
        consummate drag racing &quot;package&quot;, and the Barry Setzer team quickly set 
        the Funny Car racing world on fire.</p>
        <p align="justify">For three years the car ran at meets big and small, 
        and maintained a hectic match racing schedule as well. Setzer wrote the 
        checks and his only instructions were to run it as hard as possible. 
        Track records fell and wins piled up. The Barry Setzer Vega Funny Car 
        and team was the car to stop any time the truck and trailer drove 
        through the pit gate.</p>
        <p align="justify">After the Setzer team disbanded Foster hopped into 
        several different cars and as usual, put 'em in the show and down the 
        track until his driving retirement in 1980. Foster's considerable 
        talents were quickly snapped up by the road racing contingent, and he 
        spent several years in this segment of the industry, continuing to work 
        his magic with metals and newer, more exotic composite materials. During 
        that time he worked for a Can-Am team and was a part of the Nissan IMSA 
        factory racing team. In spite of these challenging new frontiers, 
        Patty's heart was always into drag racing.</p>
        <p align="justify">By the late 1990's the nostalgia bug had created a 
        demand for restoration race cars or complete new car builds faithful to 
        what some of the sport's best known name cars were. Foster was 
        approached and accepted the challenge, becoming the premier builder of 
        several of these jewel-like masterpieces. Foster's recreation of the 
        Beebe &amp; Mulligan car, the Jade Grenade, Wale &amp; Candies, Creitz &amp; 
        Donovan, Benny Osborn's &quot;Wizard of Oz&quot;, the Surfer's car and Tom 
        &quot;Mongoose&quot; McEwen's Indy winning English Leather Corvette Funny Car were 
        just a few of the fabulous cars he created. He had just completed the 
        recreation of New York Top Fuel racer Billy Lynch's new TF car when 
        massive, life threatening heart problems landed him in the hospital. He 
        had only recently relocated his shop and equipment from Wichita to 
        Moscow, Idaho, and had several new car building projects waiting for his 
        magic touch. Billy Lynch's typically flawless car now stands as Pat 
        Foster's final work of art in metal.</p>
        <p align="justify">As I reach the conclusion of this story I realize 
        just how inadequate my words are in describing such a major figure in 
        drag racing. Pat Foster was a superb race car driver, welder, 
        fabricator, designer and assembler. He was also a talented tuner and 
        clutch man in a game where all the secrets of going quick and fast are 
        elusively located inside the bellhousing. More so, Pat Foster was a 
        wonderful human being with a quick wit, snappy response and 
        crystal-clear knowledge and opinion on a vast array of topics, both 
        racing as well as non-racing related.</p>
        <p align="justify">In the end, with his health rapidly failing and his 
        demise imminent, he met his fate with the same quiet, iron-willed 
        strength and dignity that earmarked his life. Our world and the sport of 
        drag racing has lost one of its giants. More importantly, we've lost one 
        of our true good guys. Although the chutes are out on Patty's life, all 
        who had the good fortune to know him cherish the wonderful memories and 
        the magnificently created race cars he as his legacy.</div>
