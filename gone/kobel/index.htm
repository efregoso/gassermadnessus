      <p align="justify"><b>Ray Kobel of Hicksville New York passed away March 
      23, 2008 at the age of 65. </b></p>
      <p align="justify"><b>A native New Yorker, Ray became interested in cars 
      very young and began learning his life long skills from his father, a high 
      school metal shop teacher. Ray was an innovator, a 
      &quot;hands-on-can-do-anything-guy&quot;, the first in the neighborhood to build 
      that '40 Ford Coupe with flames and that yellow trophy winning Corvette 
      plus many others. </b></p>
      <p align="justify"><b>In 1962 at age 20 Ray and a buddy ventured out West 
      to So Cal to enjoy the fun and sun, the hot rods and to find that illusive 
      '40 Willys Coupe. Whether watching<img border="0" src="kobel-R.jpg" width="425" height="352" style="float: right; border: 3px double #000000" hspace="6"> 
      the drags at San Fernando or Lions or Irwindale drag strips, or soaking up 
      the So Cal lifestyle, Ray loved it all. </b></p>
      <p align="justify"><b>Later after finding that Willys Coupe and getting 
      homesick for New York, he flat towed it solo across the county to later 
      build it into a C/Gas wheel standing winner. He actually worked for Jack 
      Merkel and later proudly flew the Jack Merkel Racing Team banner racing 
      all over the East Coast. </b></p>
      <p align="justify"><b>Then he opened his own auto repair shop and 
      eventually went to work for the City of New York Sanitation Department as 
      a transportation supervisor until retirement. Still having that hot rod 
      itch Ray went to work part time for Classic Craft of Long Island busily 
      modifying and fabricating hot rods with his eagle eye and skilled hands, 
      &quot;quality&quot; was his motto. &quot;Just ask Ray, he knows&quot;, with his vast auto 
      knowledge and hand skills he was mentor and inspiration to anyone around 
      him. </b></p>
      <p align="justify"><b>In 2003 Ray lost his only son Matthew, they were a 
      team in the garage or out racing at the track, let's hope that they are at 
      the drag races together in heaven. </b></p>
      <p align="justify"><b>From the streets of Queens where he grew up; 
      American Bandstand where he had danced; at the east coast drag strips 
      where he raced; at California's Toluca Lake Bobs where he cruised; to the 
      many custom car shows he proudly displayed his hot rods; to the backyard 
      B-B-Q's and dinner tables with his friends; and in the arms of he beloved 
      family and grandson Kyle, Ray left his mark of quality in our hearts and 
      minds, he will be missed and remembered always. </b><br>
