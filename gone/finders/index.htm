      total of 6 Decades; he started drag racing in 1958 and did his last full 
      run in the 90’s. Chuck was not only known for his driving skills but was 
      also recognized as one of the industry’s legendary builders. In 2002 Chuck 
      completed a replica of a car remembered by most Gasser enthusiasts, the 
      SWC &amp; Chuck Finders “Dark Horse.” This car was not an exact replica; the 
      painter didn’t verify the color and only after the car was finished being 
      painted did Chuck find out it was the wrong Blue. <br>
      <br>
      In the 33 Willys “Dark Horse,” Chuck had one of many&nbsp;“30 seconds of fame 
      moments” as it was quicker than the SWC “A” car! The car was later removed 
      from the SWC team; this was Chuck’s car with a Tim Woods engine that was 
      painted to match the team’s colors. It was basically added to the SWC team 
      to help meet booking commitments. The “Dark Horse” was later converted to 
      another car, the “Traveler.” Partnered with Bill Altizer &amp; Neal Kibler, 
      this car did set and hold both speed and low ET in B/GS (146.57 MPH in 
      9.76 ET) in November 1964.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of Chuck’s cars were partnerships of this 
      type. <br>

      successfully campaigned in the professional ranks as well. In the 1970s, 
      he moved into the fuel Funny Car class. Partnerships and cars built abound 
      in this class, too. During this period Chuck was in c</font></span><span style="color: black; font-weight: 700"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">ontention 
      for the top spot in Division 3 but full sponsorship and success were 
      always a dream and never within his grasp. In the late seventies, Chuck 
      lost a leg to a Drag Racing accident. Don Garlits was at the track that 
      day; he ran down to the accident then ran back to the tower and asked 
      everyone to pray for Chuck or he wouldn’t make it. Chuck survived and 
      eventually went back to the cars he loved, the Willys.<br>
      <br>
      Chuck ended up winning his class and competing at the level he had always 
      wanted. He was a champion to those he raced with and at the same time 
      racers always said he was a racer’s racer. He just wanted to race “Balls 
      Out” and he did. Chuck was fortunate and always did it his way. Chuck 
      leaves 21 entries in Draglist.com and has touched the lives of Racers and 
      Hot Rodders around the world. If you see a 33 Willys, say Hi to Chuck, 
      because he probably had a part in it.<br>
      <br>
      A final Memorial organized by Chuck’s family was held in his Honor at the 
      NHRA Museum in Pomona on Sunday, June 7. </font></span></td>
