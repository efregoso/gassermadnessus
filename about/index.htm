OF GASSER MADNESS</b></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 4px"><b>So...where did Gasser Madness 
come from?&nbsp; Well, around 1996, I decided to sell a collection of old SS&amp;DI 
(Super Stock &amp; Drag Racing Illustrated) magazines that we had been carting along 
on every move for several years.&nbsp; I decided to go online to do that.&nbsp; 
In the process, I &quot;met up&quot; with a nu</b><b>mber of other drag racers and fans from the 
60's and 70's.&nbsp; In 1997 I attended an ANRA race in Redding, CA, the first 
drag race I'd been to since 1972.&nbsp; I was immediately sucked right back in!&nbsp;&nbsp;
</b></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 4px"><b>I'm a computer guy, so later 
that same year I decided to create a website on geocities.&nbsp; It was a 
collection of old drag racing photos.&nbsp; Eventually, I decided that it needed 
to be a bit more focused than just a collection of generic pictures and where 
better to focus than on my old love, the Gassers?&nbsp; Shortly thereafter, Bill 
Pratt on his <a href="http://www.draglist.com">DragList.com</a> site provided a 
link on his site to mine and described it as &quot;Gasser Madness&quot;.&nbsp; It was 
perfect and the name stuck!&nbsp; Over the next couple of&nbsp; years, because 
of the geocities size limits, it grew to encompass 5 separate geocities sites 
all linked and cross-linked to make it look like one big site.&nbsp; It was a 
maintenance nightmare.</b></p>

somewhere in the neighborhood of 50-75,000 photos and averages 1200-1500

My name is Byron Stack, and I'm the guy who puts the "Gasser Madness!" web site together.  Back during the "Gasser Wars" in </b>
<b>
Southern California, I crewed for Skip Hess and Jim Shores on the Shores &amp; Hess/Skipper's Critter A/GS Anglia.  In the early 70's I crewed the Revell Kit A/GS Mustang for Skip.  
By the way, while I'm certainly not the subject of the photo, that's me behind 
the Revell Kit (I believe that was the 71 Winternationals) .&nbsp; As you might guess, I've had a long love affair with the Gassers!&nbsp;

      1964.&nbsp;
Two things to notice.&nbsp; The first is the ticket number.&nbsp; I sent for the
tickets the day the meet was first announced.&nbsp; The second thing you might
notice would be the price for the 3-day admission.&nbsp; Times seem to have
changed just a bit!</b></p>

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 4px"><b>In 1970, as an ex-GI, fresh out of the Air Force, I was working as a computer operator for the Pacific Bell Revenue Accounting Office in Alhambra, CA.  That's where I met Sherrie.  It took me 4 or 5 months to work up the courage to ask her out.  Our first date was pretty much of a disaster, but she overlooked it, 
and five months later, we drove to Las Vegas (believe it or not, I missed the turnoff for Reno!) and were married.  As I'm fond of telling her, it's obvious that I was better at selecting a mate than she was!</b></p>

<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 4px"><b>We got "Simian", a Siamese cat, while we were still on our honeymoon.  Since then, we've had our ups and downs but always managed to hang in there.  We've also never been without a cat (or 10) since then!&nbsp;</b></p>

<a href="http://www.vandenberg.af.mil">Vandenberg AFB</a>, CA.  I ran a shop called the VILMF (Vandenberg Intermediate Level Maintenance Facility)  which was a depot type computer repair facility for Shuttle Program Launch Processing Computers.  Best job I ever had!  In 1987, about 9 months after the Challenger Disaster, the
Shuttle Program at
Vandyland was shut down.  I laid off my crew and followed them out the door.  I
suspect that most of us miss it a lot.&nbsp; One kind of cool footnote...around 
2001, I got phone calls from 2 of my previous employees who took the time to 
track me down to call and tell me that they had really enjoyed working for me 
back then.&nbsp; I couldn't wear a hat for a month after that! &lt;Grin&gt;</b></p>
