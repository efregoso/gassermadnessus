          other shot of a Falcon on your site and thought a few shots of my 
          Brother-in-laws Sprint would be a good add-on to your site.<br>
          This car has evolved from a quasi restore to a full blown bracket 
          racer. The engine is a 302 that puts out near 400 HP. Builder is 
          Westar Performance out of Whittier Ca.<br>
          Dan won the inaugural 2002 season Sportsman's class championship at 
          Irwindale's 1/8 mile track against some really strong cars and 
          drivers. Last year he ended as runner up in the Pro class. We attended 
          the Summit ET Finals in Tucson's' Southwestern International Raceway 
          with the Irwindale team and went four rounds! Dan was two races away 
          from becoming the Sportsman's class western champion in the NHRA's 
          Magnificent 7.<br>
