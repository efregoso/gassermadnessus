Before there were funny cars, these were the baddest doorslammers in the land.

            up the good work ! I've had several race cars and I always wanted a
            nostalgia race car . I run across this&nbsp; 53 Willys in a wrecking
            yard in OK.&nbsp; It was going to be crushed . I paid $300.00 for it
            and I plan on putting it back in it's racing condition! I have found
            the grandson of the man that built an raced it.&nbsp; He said it had
            a small block Chevy and a four speed trans . I also bought a 47 Ford
            two ton truck to restore to pull it with . I hope to make some of
            the nostalgia shows and races with&nbsp; them .<br>
