      <p align="justify"><b>Hi Byron, My name is Ron Muirhead. I sent you an 
      email and a pic of me a couple of years ago. The pic was taken when I was 
      about 6 or 7 years old beside Gary Becks Export 'A' car in Edmonton, 
      Alberta, CANADA, around 1973/74. Just wanted to let you know how much I 
      enjoy you're site. I cruise in every so often to look around, and when 
      ever I need a kick in the ass to get back on my own project. The site just 
      keeps getting better and better every time I'm here. After many years of 
      drooling over my Uncles 55 Chevy, he finally decided that he probably 
      wasn't going to ever get to it so he gave it to me, I tried to pay him 
      something for it, but he wasn't having it, he just wants to see it back on 
      the track. He built the car in 1969, got married in 1973 and the car sat 
      in the same garage in the same spot up until a year ago when I took it. 
      This is the same Uncle that took the picture of me beside Gary's car. As 
      things progress I'll send you a pic or two if you would like, so you can 
      see how things are coming along.&nbsp; This is the only Picture of my 
      Uncles car. It's from about 1971. The pic was taken in late spring when he 
      was getting ready for the upcoming race season. The car behind is my 
      Aunt's 69 340/4spd Dart that they bought new and still have today. Catch 
      you later. <br>
      Thanks again,<br>
      Ron</b></td>
