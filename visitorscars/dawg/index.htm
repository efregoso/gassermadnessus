            <p align="left"><b>Byron, This is an old picture, (and a very poor one at that), of my brother's '56 Chevy. It was at one time a C/G sb Chevy powered racer built and run in Eugene, Oregon. We bought it as you see it for $40. That is right...$40. My brother and I dropped in a 383 Dodge and 4spd. The engine was set back 18". We had wanted to run it at Balboa Dragstrip as an altered. But we got booted when it ran easy 11's through the mufflers. We didn't have a roll bar in it.  So we went street racing. We stayed in gas and beer money, and that was a LOT better at the time than we coulda done "Doin' It For Love" at Balboa. Although...the tickets we amassed, even then, were just a tad steep for a couple kids working at an Enco station. Thanks for posting all the history on your site. It is
            truly appreciated. Thanks, Jim</b></p>
