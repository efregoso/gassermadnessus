            <b>Finally after a long spring waiting for parts to get the new 
            configuration of the blown alcohol 55 Chevy on the track, the crew 
            from Shoebox racing unveiled the flamed '55 at the 3rd annual Rocky 
            Mountain Nationals in Edmonton, Alberta. The northern national event 
            would be a great place to shake down the new combination as engine 
            builder Bob Atchison and two time world champion pro funny car pilot 
            Rob Atchison would be on hand to answer any last minute tune up 
            questions. <br>
            <br>
            Wednesday's arrival found torrential downpours in Edmonton so the 
            rig had to be staged at a nearby truckstop with dozens of other 
            racers. Thursday's weather was chilly yet much more favourable and 
            all of the rigs were then moved into the pits at Budweiser 
            Motorsports Park.<br>
            <br>
            Driver Duane Grosart was faced with many new challenges in the car 
            including a four speed Lenco transmission opposed to the three speed 
            he has used for years and also a hand brake instead of the foot 
            brake of past. The first pass would be a learning experience for 
            Duane and an inaugural run for the revamped &quot;Shoebox&quot;. The class 
            that the team would be running is called Thunderbolt and all entries 
            must run no quicker than 7.5 seconds. Although the '55 is capable of 
            much quicker times, it was decided that this would be a good 
            platform on which to test and work the bugs out of the new ride.<br>
            <br>
            By Friday the weather was good to go in Edmonton and the car was 
            readied for the first qualifying pass as well as the first pass ever 
            with the new setup. The team was called up at four pm and the wait 
            in the staging lanes was surprisingly short and before we knew it, 
            the car was under the bridge at the starting line of Budweiser 
            Motorsports Park and getting fired up. Duane did a quick 
            conservative burnout and then backed the car and prepared to stage. 
            Everyone looked on in anticipation as Duane launched and ran the car 
            quite softly to a 7.558 at 183.57 mph and straight up the middle of 
            the lane. By the end of first round the Shoebox Racing '55 was atop 
            the qualifiers in the number one position. First passes seldom look 
            that pretty. <br>
            <br>
            The next qualifier was to run at 8 pm and after a few minor 
            adjustments the car was once again at the line. Cal Tebb had just 
            bettered the number one spot with a 7.53 so Shoebox currently sat 
            number two. Once again Duane did a quick burnout, staged the car and 
            shot right up the middle to a 7.510 at 183.02 mph. The 3/4 full 
            stands were heard to loudly cheer over the roar of the next pair of 
            cars in the burnout box as the wildly popular flamed '55 recaptured 
            the number one qualifying spot.<br>
            <br>
            Saturday once again found Edmonton and Budweiser Motorsports Park 
            under heavy rainfall conditions so not much happened other than some 
            visiting with old friends and lots of admirers hanging around 
            checking out the refurbished car and new trailer.<br>
            <br>
            Sunday morning was overcast but dry so the final qualifying pass was 
            nixed and the Thunderbolt class was moved directly into 
            eliminations. The Shoebox team would be paired first round with pit 
            neighbour Shawn Bulechowsky in his Chevy II. Hand brake 
            unfamiliarity caught up with Duane this time though and the '55 red 
            lit handing the win over to the other lane and ending the race day 
            for Team Shoebox. The capacity crowd cheered the crew as the car 
            returned to the pits.<br>
            <br>
            The agony of defeat did not last long as the weekend was extremely 
            prosperous as far as data acquisition and just successfully getting 
            the car down the track with all of its changes. A great time was had 
            by all and northern Alberta and all the racers attending from all 
            over North America know who Shoebox Racing is now.<br>
            <br>
