            <p align="left"><b>Byron, I would like to send you a few pictures of a 55 Chevy I used to race in&nbsp;the northeast back in the early 70s.  I raced mostly at New York National&nbsp;Speedway and Englishtown raceway park in New Jersey.  As you can see from the&nbsp;picture it was and F/Gas car for most of its life and this picture was taken at&nbsp;Raceway park around 1973. There are other pictures also at my website below and&nbsp;you can use anything you like.  I am still active in drag racing with a few&nbsp;friends and we will be campaigning a car in the altered class next year.  Hope&nbsp;to hear from you soon.<br>
