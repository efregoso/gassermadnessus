      <b>Byron, Here is a picture of my wife and my old 57. This car was raced 
      in California until it was brought to Michigan in the 70s. It sat in a 
      garage for about 30 years until I picked it up. I had to sell the car when 
      I moved to Arizona. I always wanted to know more about it's racing 
      history, so maybe if you post it, someone might recognize the car. </b>

      <p align="justify"><b>Just a little history on the car photo below shown 
		in Visitors rides on your web site.<br>
		I bought this car from a friend of mine in 1963. It is a 210 hard top 
		and it was black lacquer at the time. It had a 4-71 blown 327 with one 
		carter C series side drafted.</b><FONT SIZE="7"><b><img border="0" src="6_small.jpg" width="150" height="112" hspace="3" vspace="2" align="right"></b></FONT><b><br>
		The car was all original except for the engine and radiator. It had a 
		three speed on the column with overdrive. After I bought the car I 
		pumped up the engine some what with a Gilmer 2&quot; belt drive replacing the 
		Cragar 3 V belt set up. Installed two E series Carters and a turbo 400 
		plus a olds rear end with 4.88 gears. This was just a street driven car 
		and never raced at the track. Later on I replaced the now 331 4-71 blown 
		engine with a stock 350 with an Engle cam. Then I did race it on 
		Wednesday nights at OCIR just for fun. 13.45 @ 107. Long story short I 
		had a fender bender on the rear quarter panel. I got the insurance money 
		and used it on flying lessons which led to a 26 year career with the 
		airlines. I sold the car as is to a co worker in 1969. He later told me 
		if I saw it at the track I could tell it was mine because it was painted 
		some shade of orange and was lettered &quot;The Great Pumpkin&quot;. I have no 
		knowledge as to its racing status after I sold it. I will never sell 
		another car ever. LOL!!!<br>
		The Blown engine and turbo from that car went into a gold '57 that was 
		featured in Car Craft, Popular Hotrod, Super Chevy, and again in Car 
		Craft, and also 'The Best of Car Craft 2004 50th year anniversary issue&quot;<br>
		See second car photo..<br>
