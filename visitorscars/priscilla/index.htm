            <b>Byron, This Clay Allen's '50 F1 Ford pickup. It has run at Woodburn Dragstrip since '87. It is all Ford, 460, C6, 9inch. The chassis is near stock, just has home built ladder bars, and housing floater. The truck has run a 10.66 @ 124mph. Clay has done all the work
            himself. The "patina" was left as is once it became very popular with the local fans. Clay won't race the truck this year, but will be back next year with an all new engine. We are hoping to put the 3300+ pound truck in the very low 10's with the new stuff. Photo
            is from George and Karen Adams, <a href="mailto:www.nwdragracing.com"> www.nwdragracing.com</a> George and Karen are the coolest people, and they have this truck all over their website. Thanks Byron, Jim "Dawg" Ullman
