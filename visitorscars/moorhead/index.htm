      <b>Hey Byron,<br>
      Here are a few pics of our 1941 Willys Pickup. My father built it, and 
      began racing it in 1996. Since then it has gone through many changes. You 
      may remember it being red, until my dad rolled it at the 2002 March Meet 
      because of lack of downforce. It is currently only primered and will 
      probably stay that way for a while haha. I actually just received my 
      license and am also driving the truck (I&#8217;m 20 years old). Look for us both 
      driving in the 8.60 B/Gas class in Goodguys and West Coast Pro Gas here in 
      California. As for the truck, it has a 572 c.i. Mopar Keith black block, 
      and a Powerglide. The engine is actually right out of the Renteria Bros. 
      Valiant. The truck has run a best of 7.96 @ 170 m.p.h. with this motor. We 
      also have a 499 c.i. Pro Stock Dodge Wedge motor, that has run 7.84 @ 172 
      m.p.h. We know it will run the 7.60 A/Gas number, it has shown us really 
      good half track numbers with new carbs but we are going to take it easy 
      for awhile and slow it down. We have plans of a new longer, lower truck, 
      chromemoly, Liberty 5-Speed etc. so hopefully you will see this in the 
      near future. You have an awesome site and hope to see you at the races!<br>
