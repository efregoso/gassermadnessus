      I have really enjoyed looking at this site for the past year. Since I have 
      been checking out the gassers and old style drag cars I have been trying 
      to find something to put together. I had a lead on a 51 Henry J but like 
      most of them it was gone. So I had just went on with my other project and 
      figured that I will get one of the cars to make a gasser when the time is 
      right. Well, after a few months had passed I had went whit a friend to 
      pick up a 63 Chevy that he had bought from a guy and needless to say there 
      was a car there that I just had to have. So I played it off as though I 
      liked it but that I was not all that interested in it. So I had gone home 
      and just about freaked out. I began looking at this website with dreams of 
      getting this car. Finally the day came and the guy had stopped by my house 
      and he fell in love with our Conversion van. Since we were not using it at 
      the moment I had offered it to him for an even trade. Well, he went home 
      and a week later he agreed to trade. This was the start of what has become 
      a sickening disease for me to get this car done for the shows this year. I 
      can honestly say that I. Love having this disease and I hope that there is 
      never a cure for it. Well, I hope to see my little 55 posted upon your 
      site and I will gladly post pics as I move on with the progress of &quot;gittin 
      r done&quot;. Picture 1 is the way it was when I found it, 2 is when I got it 
      home and began to mock the car up with what I had, and picture 3 is the 
      way it is right at the moment.<br>
      Thanks Joe Lockwood</b></td>
