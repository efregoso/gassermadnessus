          <td width="100%" align="center">Hey Byron, great site! I visit every 
          so often to check out the new stuff. Great bunch of people! I wanted 
          to send some pics of my '55, as well as some pics of my good friend's 
          that he is rebuilding. I'll start with my orange '55 that is out of 
          Ohio. Here is the story I put together from info gathered form the 
          previous owner.<br>
          <br>
          The story begins back in the early 70’s in Canton, Ohio. Inspired by 
          movies like Two-Lane Blacktop and American Graffiti, two brothers and 
          their best friend (the wrench) set out to build their version of a 
          wicked ‘55 Chevy. While still in high school, these buddies spend the 
          next 3 years from ‘73-’76 building this car. The paint is as it was 
          shot back in ‘73. A ‘69 Nova 12 bolt rear with 4.56 Zoom gears was 
          installed early on as they kept breaking the stock rear end launching 
          the car in the driveway. By 1975-1976, they started getting the key 
          elements together. A beefed up Turbo 400 trans was put together and 
          after a visit to “Black Bart” at BUDCO H.P Parts in Canton, a Banana 
          3000 stall converter was installed. On April 2, 1975 the L-88 427 
          crate motor was purchased at Marhofer Chevrolet in Stow, Ohio for a 
          mere $819.52. The brothers went on a shopping spree and started to 
          collect all the necessary speed equipment such as Sun gauges, JR big 
          tube headers, and more. There are many receipts from a local parts 
          store you may have heard of; Summit Auto Center. Back then, they had 
          two locations in Akron, Ohio...........long before they exploded on 
          the mail-order scene.<br>
          <br>
          By late ‘76 the car was getting closer to being finished. Then after 
          they graduated high school, one of the brothers got married, and the 
          car was parked for a few years. In 1980, one of the brothers was going 
          through a divorce and needed to sell the car. The best friend (the 
          wrench) worked out a deal so he could get the car and finish it. By 
          ‘83 he had taken the body off the frame a gone through the underside, 
          detailing and replacing everything. It was now in good working order 
          and driven sparingly (under 2000 miles) over the next 19 years.<br>
          <br>
          In the fall of 2001, I found an ad for a ‘55 Chevy for sale. All the 
          ad said was 1955 Chevrolet Bel Air, 427, AT. After talking with the 
          owner, I knew this was the car I wanted. It was an old school 
          survivor, that needed alot of detailing. Over the past year and a 
          half, I have made subtle changes to make the car into what it is 
          today. The paint is untouched, runs and all from 1973. I reworked the 
          wheel wells and added a vintage set of American 200S mags I restored 
          to 1969 specs. The vintage decals were added along the way to give it 
          that nostalgia gasser look. This spring, the engine was put on 
          steroids. The beast now puts out close to 675 HP with solid roller cam 
          &amp; fully ported vintage aluminum heads to go along with the stout 
          12.5:1 compression. I have yet to run it down the strip yet, but it 
          sees quite a bit of cruising. This is one killer street car that flat 
          gets with it. It lives on strictly 110 octane race gas, and at a clip 
          of 4 mpg, I make the trips short and sweet!<br>
          <br>
          My friend, Bill Fowler rescued an old gasser '55 near the old Lions 
          Drag strip in Long Beach, CA where it had been sitting since it last 
          raced there in '72.
          <p>Man I don't know where to start, but here are some pics of the 
          X-Lions drag car that my friend Bill picked up last Spring. He chased 
          this car for almost a year and a half before the guy would sell. It 
          was originally purchased form a young guy in LA after the car and it's 
          big block had been stolen....twice!! This was around '66-'67. It has a 
          Blair's Speed Shop straight axle, Tony Nancy interior, and all the 
          goodies from the day. Don Nunes, the owner raced at Lions, Irwindale, 
          San Fernando, Bakersfield, and all over. The timeslips he showed us 
          showed the quickest time to be an 11.92 at Lions. Don told us he won 
          many trophies in many classes. D/G, E/G, F/G, etc., he would change 
          carbs or whatever depending on how many cars were in class that 
          weekend. He last raced the car in '72 at the Last Race at Lions. The 
          car was then parked for over 30 years out in a yard at a house he 
          owned. It sat under trees and had so much crap piled on it, it was 
          hard to tell what it was. It took a full day to drag it out of the 
          hole it was in. It was rusty, and full of rats. We got the 301 SBC, 
          Hilborn unit, 4-speeds, and some other stuff with the car. The car has 
          alot of vintage stuff including all the original decals on the side 
          glass, Olds/Pontiac rear, manual line lock (this was a lever you 
          pulled to hold down the brake pedal while your feet were on the gas 
          and clutch.). The car was a shade of dark metallic green without any 
          sponsors or lettering on the body. Big radiused wheel wells also. We 
          are looking for pictures of this car so if you have any we would 
          really appreciate anyone who could copy, scan them for our archives.<br>
          <br>
          A year ago this month the car was separated from body and the body was 
          sent down to San Diego for sheetmetal/ body/ paint. The guy spent 
          eight months making it flawless! It will stay in primer gray. The 
          wheel wells were redone to same contour but reinforced with an flared 
          lip (looks better too.) A vintage Offy polished scoop was added to 
          hood too. The frame has been sandblasted, and repainted, and the rear 
          has been gone through with new axles, and 4.11 gear set. Chrome 
          reverse wheels were added with vintage looking bias plys up front and 
          M/T ET Street slicks for the street duty. Now comes the fun part of 
          reassembly. It is so nostalgic, and has the perfect stance. The car is 
          down in Northridge, CA at Bill's house. It has come a long way but 
          still has a bit to go. The goal is to have it be a streetable car with 
          many of the vintage details intact. Stay tuned!<br>
          <br>
          It would be great if you could post these stories and pics. Again, 
          thanks for the great website!<br>
          <br>
