      Here is a picture of an Austin Gasser that used to run at quite a few 
      Midwest tracks back in the later 60s and early 70s<br>
      The car was owned by Joe Carter and Dave Kinsel from Springfield, IL. 
      (Dave did the driving)<br>
      The car disappeared in the early 70s... <br>
      A few weeks ago I found it sitting behind a shed out in the country near 
      Lincoln, IL. <br>
      I bought what was left of it.<br>
      It's in pretty poor condition today but it still has the original straight 
      tube axle, fiberglass seat, Corvair steering box, aluminum interior with 
      broken gauges, alum gas pedal, chute release and the rest of the original 
      uncut chassis and roll bar.<br>
      Attached is one of my original pictures of the car at Drag City in 
      Springfield, IL. (1970)<br>
      Thanks, Bob Gibson</b></td>

      found it, Pretty sad... I bought it anyway... and after all of the times I 
      enjoyed seeing it run during the early days, I thought if it's going to 
      just sit and rot away, I can let it sit at my place at least nobody's 
      going to haul it off to the scrapyard. (the steel one piece frontend also 
      was there, I got it too) <br>
