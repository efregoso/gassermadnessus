          <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><b>I ran an unblown 345 
          Inch Olds Willys at Lions and held the B/G unblown record there as 
          well as the NHRA record set in March of 1963. Unfortunately I have 
          only one picture of the car plus the NHRA record certificate.&nbsp; 
          Attached is the only photo I have.<br>
          The car was names &quot;Outnumbered&quot; because it was an Olds. I won every 
          week and was always getting protested for it. Some poor loser would 
          come up to me and say &quot;One of these days a Chevy is going to beat you. 
          I would comment back, &quot; They should, they outnumber me 100 to one&quot;.<br>
          I now have a 56 BBW Ford f100 that I call &quot;Outnumbered&quot; because I 
          stayed with the original Y-Block motor (not to follow the group with a 
          Chevy). I warmed it up a little and it runs quite well. It has A/C, 
          P/S, Disc Brakes with power, AM-FM-Cassette, with a 6 deck CD Player, 
          automatic trans.<br>
          I do like Chevies, I had a 468 in my ski boat, dragged and circle 
          raced with Chevies. I just like to be different.</b></p>
