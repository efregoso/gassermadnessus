        Anglia (Red &amp; White)&nbsp;that is on the visitors ride page. Since I 
        originally sent in the info we have found out more and some of what we 
        were originally told is incorrect.&nbsp;I would appreciate it if you could

        <b>The car was built at Blair's with Pete Eastwood doing most of the 
        chassis work (not Chuck Finders as listed). It&nbsp;was owned by Jay Lindsley 
        who&nbsp;I have had recent contact with and was able to get original photos 
        from. We are putting it back the way it was with a 427 Hilborn injected 
        Chevy and 4 speed Muncie. It will even be painted the same with the 
        blessing of Don Blair and Phil Lukens. Hope to have it up and running 
        this year by October.</b></div>
