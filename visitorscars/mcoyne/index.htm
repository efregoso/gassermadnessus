          picture of my primered coupe next to my friend <br>
          Randy Miller's Willys pick up. He sold the pick up to a guy back east 
          but is now building a '51 Austin from the ground up with a Chrysler 
          motor, that says it all.<br>
          My coupe is an all steel '38 with a '41 front end and dash, Gasser 
          Style, Blown 468, straight front axle, front disc brakes, not tubbed, 
          old school.<br>
          I've had a lot of help getting it on the road by my friend Wayne 
          Baker, who by the way has a steel '40 Willys coupe [Pro Street] and 
          his wife Barb has a steel '42 Willys pick up [even his Brother-in-law 
          Mark has a steel Willys sedan].<br>
          The car is currently at my friend Chris Bacciocco's shop, he's doing a 
          complete frame off <br>
          restoration, he built the full roll cage, boxed the frame and is now 
          working on building the quarter eliptic rear leaf spring suspension, 
          ladder bars, crossmembers, front suspension, body mounts, engine 
          mounts, all the sheet metal, the works. The car is being set up to run 
          C Gas. Thank God for good friends. <br>
          Great site, keep up the good work, thanks for the spot,<br>

          <b>Hey Byron, I recently sent you a picture of my Willys coupe and I 
          just thought I'd forward you a picture of a pick up that I built in 
          1969, right out of Nam. I still have it today in fact we took it to a 
          car meet last night. <br>
          I drew it up while in the Service and built it as soon as I got out.
          <br>
          It's a Model A Ford pick up [steel], fenderless, top chopped, 
          channeled, shortened bed, <br>
          boxed frame with new crossmembers, I cut the back of the frame off and 
          added a longer section to install a '69 Mustang [9&quot;] rear suspension 
          with ladder bars for it, hooks up well. <br>
          It's not really a Gasser like the Willys but it does have a '40 Ford 
          straight axle in front, blown 383 stroker with a 4-speed trans 
          [thought you might get a kick out of that], Detroit Locker, etc; lots 
          of fun on the street.<br>
          That's it Byron, thanks for your time, keep up the good work on the 
          site,<br>
