            <p align="left"><b>Hi Byron, My name is Michael Gaines. I just wanted to send a little message to tell you how cool I think your
            site is. It is the best out there. There is no other place that has so many
            cool pictures of real race cars. I was born too late to take part in that era. But there is no other era for
            me. I went to High School from 90'-93'. I drove a 1963' Impala with a
            straight axle with a very high nose bleed stance. I look back now and it upsets me because the trend is shifting towards that
            era. But not too long ago when I was driving my 63' to High School, most
            people just thought it was wrong. Now look where the trends are going. Regretfully I had to sell my high school
            car for what has always been my dream car. A 1940 Ford Coupe. But not a
            50,000 dollar "Street Rod!" A real Hot Rod. And a car that stands out from the crowd and gets peoples attention 4 Blocks
            away when I drive it to the local cruise nights or Grudge Nights at the
            Track.&nbsp; I know the Tunnel Ram isn't to Nostalgic for Gasser Coupes, but I am on a
            definite budget.  I hope to build a blown small block Chevy for it. Keep up the great job of supplying pictures to Gasser Freaks like me. They
            are awesome.<br>
            Regards,&nbsp; Michael</b><p align="left"><font color="#FF0000"><b>
            Though Michael no longer has this car, I wanted to leave it here so 
            you could all see what&nbsp; cool piece it is.&nbsp; Not all Gassers 
            are Willys or Anglias!&nbsp; Byron</b></font></td>
