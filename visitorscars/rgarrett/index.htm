          a car (1950 Ford) called the Outer Limits. It ran F/MP at Atco, NJ 
          around 1961. The car is still complete but in sad shape. I just sold 
          it and it is for sale again locally. Thought someone might want to see 
          it. Also, I have a 1954 Ford Skyliner (glasstop) Gasser with the 
          factory plexiglass hood. It runs a 292 with 6 Holley 94's and a three 
          speed on the floor. Should be done in time for the Indy Rockabilly 
          Rumble in the summer and maybe Vegas in April. I would love to see 
          more pictures of the 1951 Victoria that was destroyed (and shots of 
          the bullet ridden legislators that made that happen). Thanks.<br>
