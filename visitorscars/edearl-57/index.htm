          visitor's section. This 57 had roots in the Calumet City IL area. It 
          was purchased by me in the mid 70s and found a new home in the Midway 
          area of Chicago. I frequent visitor of Dukes Drive on 81st Harlem in 
          the late 70s, as well as Archer Ave. Like many other cars, it was 
          disassembled and stored in boxes for the past 30 years. It's been put 
          back together in the last few years. Ed Earl</b></td>
