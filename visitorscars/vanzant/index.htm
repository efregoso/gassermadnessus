		About 20 years ago I picked up a questionably built shadetree gasser 
		1940 Chevy coupe. It was metallic burgundy in color. It had a '59 
		Pontiac 389 with a factory tri power, a Spalding Flamethrower ignition 
		and a Jetaway trans with a 57 Olds rear. I was told by an old man who 
		used to work on it that it used to run at the San Diego Raceway at 
		Ramona, CA. It had been in a collision with a low wall, 50 Ford straight 
		axle and sheetmetal were shot. I went the Street Rod route with a 
		Mustang II up front. I replaced the tired 389 with a 455 Poncho and 
		th400. I raced it for years that way. A couple of months ago, I returned 
		it to it's gasser roots with a tube axle and parallel leafs. These pix 
		are from its first outing on the new front suspension where I won my 
		class at the King of Clubs race at Barona Speedway in San Diego. I'm 
		sending 3 pics in case you're interested. By the way, the car was 
		featured in Ol' Skool Rods, called the &quot;Devil's Grocery Gasser&quot; after my 
		club, the Road Devils. I also write a regular column in Car Kulture 
		DeLuxe called &quot;The Boulevard Crawl&quot;.<br>
