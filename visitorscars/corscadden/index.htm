&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't know if this will qualify 
          as a gasser-type ride or not, but it's sure looked upon as nostalgic 
          by the competitors that I race with in the IHRA Hot Rod class (or 
          maybe that's me that they think of as old &amp; crusty) Anyway, with the 
          exception of the 'glass flip front, doors &amp; trunk, it's all Chevy 
          steel, Alston tube chassis with 7.50 sec cert., Most of all the car's 
          original brightwork is still in place, and it still has most of the 
          original dash, even though it's got an eight inch engine setback. It's 
          got a mildly built 555&quot; Dart based BBC, with a T400 trans &amp; Ford 9&quot; 
          rear. Best numbers for the car to date with the throttle stop turned 
          off are 9.40 @ 141 mph. It's a fun ride. You've got a great site. Keep 
          up the good work!<br>
