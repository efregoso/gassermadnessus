		From time to time I check out your website, I love it!. I have owned a 
		lot of 567 cars, and a lot of other cars for that matter. Always had to 
		sell one to get one, and I wanted them all...Had a few straight axle 
		cars too. Still plan to build another someday. Anyway, recently I 
		discovered a picture of one of my old racecars on your site. A photo by 
		Ralph Reiter of Cheap Thrills at mission raceway. I thought I would send 
		you a couple more pics of it.<br>
		I built the car on a severe budget, (my competitors had more money in 
		their heads than I did in the car) but I had a lot of fun with it. It 
		was a hardtail, so I had to run almost no air in the slicks, and 
		couldn't use the nitrous till drive.<br>
		Somwhere I have a pic of my 427 tunnel ram, flip front, straight axle 57 
		wagon, from the 70's. I wish I took more pictures back then, but.... <br>
		Thanks for the great website, Doug Steven</b></td>
