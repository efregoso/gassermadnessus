      <p align="justify"><b>Hi Byron...I wrote you a short note a while back but 
      guess that you get many. (<font color="#FF0000">Yes I do, and thanks for 
      your patience!</font>)<br>
      In your <a href="../../trifives/index.html">Tri Chevy pages</a> you show a 
      '57 Chevy, Super Pumpkin, raced by Bill Casey many years back. I thought 
      that you may like to know the whereabouts of that car now! In the mid 
      1970's it was shipped over to the UK and owned and raced by two friends of 
      mine, Pete and Maggie Devlin. I was the crewman on the car and we operated 
      as a team until about 1980. The car was then sold and raced in the UK 
      under the new name of 'Hellraiser' by Dave Mingay.<br>
      The car was then sold again and ended up in Sweden as a street car. I lost 
      touch with it at this stage.<br>
      This year I have been put in touch with the new owners in Sweden who have 
      bought the car in poor condition. They are restoring it to its 1976 
      condition as we raced it and I enclose a picture of it racing at 
      Snetterton during the 1976 season.<br>
      I loved that car with a passion and have always regretted not buying it 
      when I had the opportunity. It shaped a lifelong passion for me with my 
      own cars and I am proud to be part of it's extensive history.<br>
      May I add that you have put up a fantastic site here which has brought a 
      great deal of pleasure to many of us 'over the ocean''!<br>
      Kind regards<br>
