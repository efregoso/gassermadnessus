            <p align="left"><b>Hi Byron,&nbsp; I thought I would show you a few
            photos just taken of my coupe. This was a 3 year project and I'm still finishing it off. It's all steel and although
            it's low tech I can honestly say that 95% of it was completed in my  garage
            working solo. I even shot the paint in the back yard. It has  a small block
            and the combination should get me into the 11's easily. Not the fastest
            thing out there, but fast enough for me right now.<br>
   Your site started out as an inspiration for me to build this car as they looked in the old days, and then it became one of my best sources for
            documentation so I could get ideas. I was lucky to find an uncut car so
            creating a gasser out of it required me to start from scratch.   I have purchased many parts off of your classifieds, and sold just as
            many too. Plus I was able to make a lot of contacts which helped me tremendously, and I have been able to "repay" those favors by giving advice
            to some of the folks I met through your site. Cool Stuff!&nbsp;<br>
   I'm still looking in on the site every day, but wanted to say thanks for the hard work I'm sure must be required to manage a site like the Gasser
            Madness. Attached are some shots of the fruits of my labors. I hope you
            like the way I've done the car. Look at 'em and toss 'em out, use them,
            whatever. I could write a book on all I had to do to build this thing and
            all I had to learn in the process, but I don't want to bore you. Suffice to
            say I think I'm going to find that I enjoyed the buildup more than I will
            the driving. Man, did I have some fun...<br>
