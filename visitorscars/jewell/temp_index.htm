      <b>hi...I love your gasser madness page...the old race car pictures blow 
      me away...I noticed you have a section on lost and found race cars...I 
      have a sorry story for you...Bill &quot;Grumpy' Jenkins raced a 55 Chevy early 
      in his career...it was called the &quot;Monster Mash&quot;...in the early seventies 
      I was offered a 55 Chevy for sale...the car was cheeseholed... {the frame 
      and body were lightened by cutting away as much metal as possible} it 
      turned out that the car was the original &quot;Monster Mash&quot; 55 Chevy ...I 
      turned down the car...at the time I lived in a small town in northwestern 
      NJ...the &quot;Monster Mash&quot; wound up getting crushed for junk...if you can 
      possibly get a picture of the car while Jenkins raced it I would 
      appreciate seeing it...meanwhile here is a picture of my 55 Chevy...which 
      is unmolested and I have owned for thirty years...</b><p><b>Thanks in 
      advance...Henry A Jewell, Great Meadows, NJ</b></p>
      <p><font color="#FF0000"><b>So...anyone have a decent Monster Mash pic, 
      please
