&nbsp;<br>
      Racing fans treated to stories from the track roadster era at Wally Parks 
      NHRA Motorsports Museum<br>
      <br>
      POMONA, Calif.&nbsp; (Dec. 2, 2005) - The Hall of Champions at the Wally 
      Parks NHRA Motorsports Museum lived up to its name as four racing icons 
      gathered with more than 200 devoted fans for the Legends Tour Lunch.&nbsp; 
      The recently held event corresponded with the opening of the Museum's new 
      track roadster exhibit based on Dick Wallen's new book Roaring Roadsters: 
      the Road to Indy, which explores the California Roadster Associations (CRA) 
      history from 1946 through 1956.<br>
      <br>
      Rounds of applause and waves of laughter were common during the event as 
      Indy 500 winners Parnelli Jones and Jim Rathmann, along with Walt James 
      and Art Chrisman, told stories and fielded questions from guest moderator 
      Bob &quot;Voice of the Indy 500&quot; Jenkins, ABC's play-by-play analyst for the 
      &quot;Greatest Spectacle in Racing.&quot;&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      &quot;It was a simpler time when these men were behind the wheel,&quot; said 
      Jenkins.&nbsp; &quot;I grew up in Liberty, Indiana, where the day of the Indy 
      500 was more important than Christmas.&nbsp; Names like Rathmann and Jones 
      were sacred.&nbsp; Hoover Motor Express, Dean Van Lines * even the 
      sponsors were magic.&quot; <br>
      <br>
      It was a celebration of the long and storied history of the sport, with 
      many hallowed racing figures in attendance.&nbsp; Ninety-two year old NHRA 
      founder and Museum namesake, Wally Parks was even on hand to say a few 
      words.&nbsp; &quot;I can't say how much I appreciate the turnout here today,&quot; 
      said Parks.&nbsp; &quot;When I look around this room so many precious memories 
      come flooding back.&nbsp; &quot;For instance, I first remember seeing J.C. 
      Agajanian in his cowboy hat at Southern Ascot Speedway more than 70 years 
      ago struggling to push his sprint car down the track.&nbsp; When I went 
      down to help, I couldn't have known that it was the start of a friendship 
      that would help perpetuate this form of racing.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      J.C. Agajanian Jr., who was there to discuss his family's 50-year history 
      promoting the famed Turkey Night Grand Prix, praised Parks for his 
      lifelong involvement in the sport.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      Said Agajanian, &quot;When you helped my father push his car * you pushed 
      yourselves into history.&quot; <br>
      <br>
      On the other end of the spectrum, 23-year old USAC National Sprint Car 
      Champion Levi Jones was seen with honoree Jim Rathmann perusing the 
      historic track roadsters in the exhibit hall.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      &quot;I've got tremendous respect for the original roadster drivers, and I 
      appreciate everything they've done for the sport,&quot; said Jones. <br>
      To which Rathmann responded, &quot;Hell, we didn't know any better.&nbsp; Back 
      in my day, seat belts weren't for safety * they were for back support.&quot;
      <br>
      <br>
      Greg Sharp, curator of the Museum, began the program with a brief history 
      of hot rodding and how the sport has evolved over the decades. <br>
      <br>
      &quot;The American Automobile Association considered this form of racing 
      dangerous, reckless and a menace,&quot; said Sharp.&nbsp; &quot;Today, the 
      Automobile Club of Southern California -- the Triple A's largest affiliate 
      -- sponsors this Museum, which we consider a living tribute to the sport.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      After introducing the participants, Jenkins described his first 
      Indianapolis 500 experience.&nbsp; &quot;During my first Indy way back in 1960, 
      I was convinced Jim Rathmann was waving to me in the grandstands every 
      time he rounded Turn 4.&nbsp; It was an exciting experience for a young 
      man.&quot; <br>
      <br>
      Rathmann later chided Jenkins saying, &quot;You must be a coward because you 
      never waved back!&quot;<br>
      <br>
      The honorees each admitted to being street racers before taking their 
      sport to the track.&nbsp; Rathmann, in particular, was not reluctant to 
      describe his early days competing on Los Angeles' many boulevards and 
      avenues.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      &quot;I think I held the record for most speeding tickets in Los Angeles,&quot; 
      recalled Rathmann.&nbsp; &quot;At one time, I had accumulated 48 outstanding 
      tickets, four of which I managed to collect in one lunch hour.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Rathmann added, &quot;I had a lot of trouble with cops back then, and I still 
      do today!&quot; <br>
      <br>
      Parnelli Jones described an instance when a motorcycle police officer 
      pulled him over for speeding.&nbsp; &quot;He sidled right up to my window, 
      leaned in, looked me square in the eye and asked, 'Who do you think you 
      are?&nbsp; Parnelli Jones?'&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Jenkins asked the panelists to share their feelings on the track roadster 
      days, and while all had fond memories, each of the men agreed that early 
      incarnations of the sport weren't always practiced with safety in mind.&nbsp; 
      Lengths of rope were substituted for seat belts while a t-shirt and a pair 
      of jeans was the standard uniform.<br>
      <br>
      When asked if he ever had any desire to race dirt roadsters, founding 
      member of the 200 mph club at Bonneville Salt Flats, Art Chrisman said, &quot;I 
      tried it, and it scared the (expletive) out of me.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      &quot;I remember one particular day when Jim Rathmann forgot his helmet,&quot; 
      chuckled Jones.&nbsp; &quot;He was more worried about being identified 
      correctly then keeping his skull intact, so he painted his number on his 
      forehead.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      Continued Jones, &quot;Because of that kind of behavior, I've always felt 
      responsible for keeping Rathmann alive.&nbsp; After all, he's the oldest 
      past winner of the Indianapolis 500, and I'm next in line!&quot;<br>
      <br>
      Jones, who won Indy in 1963, also reflected on his heartbreaking loss in 
      1967 when a small, inexpensive part broke on the Pratt &amp; Whitney Turbine 
      he was driving for Andy Granatelli.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;There were only a couple more laps to go, and I could've pulled ahead any 
      time I wanted,&quot; said Jones.&nbsp; &quot;It was a tough loss, but I also knew 
      winning wouldn't have been as good as the first time.&quot;&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      Some of the anecdotes were revealing.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      Rathmann spent a few years in the Midwest racing for Andy Granatelli at 
      Soldier's Field after seeing a $10K winner's pot advertised in Speed Sport 
      News. <br>
      <br>
      &quot;I became a regular driver for Granatelli,&quot; said Rathmann.&nbsp; 
      &quot;Sometimes a driver would get to $400 finish second just to keep the 
      excitement level up among the crowd.&nbsp; It was also standard practice 
      to send the ambulance out with its lights blaring and sirens howling each 
      time there was a crash even if it was minor with no injuries.&quot; <br>
      <br>
      Walt James, long-time president of the CRA, revealed how he began his 
      20-plus year stint leading the organization.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;I was on my way back from Clovis (Calif.) with Bud Winfield, designer of 
      the Novi.&nbsp; There was an accident and Bud was killed, and I ended up 
      spending the next two months in the hospital.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      &quot;There I was in traction when one day I got the news I had been elected 
      president of the CRA.&nbsp; The thing was, I didn't even know I was 
      running for office!&nbsp; It seems nobody else wanted the job.&quot;&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      A feeling of levity filled the Hall of Champions as the panelists - all 
      long-time friends - traded barbs and shared stories with an audience made 
      mostly up of other racing notables.&nbsp; As the discussion continued, it 
      was easy to see that Walt James' simple life philosophy translates well to 
      events like the Legends Tour Lunch.<br>
      <br>
      &quot;If you talk a better race,&quot; said James. &quot;You'll have a better ride.&quot; </b></p>
