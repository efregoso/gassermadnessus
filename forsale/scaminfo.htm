      While the majority of people involved in the hobby of rodding are honest 
      and well-intentioned people, there are some basic guidelines we would 
      encourage you to use when buying or selling a car over a distance.&nbsp;It's 
      not like buying a car from around the corner.&nbsp; In addition to 
      basics,&nbsp;there are also some scams you should be aware of.&nbsp;We try to inform 
      you of any shady dealings that we hear of but there are bound to be 
      innovative crooks out there with something new at every turn in the road 
      …..&nbsp;<br></span>

<b> <font size="4">URGENT NOTICE</font></b></font></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><br><b>
      Jan 2008-</b>&nbsp; We have just heard about some rodders being scammed on 
      cars they had seen on other online publications but wanted to pass this 
      very important information along to you.&nbsp;In these cases&nbsp;people lost&nbsp;$30k 
      in one deal and another person lost $100k in another deal both buying a 
      car from someone in Canada.&nbsp;They did not look at the car or have anyone 
      look at it but were sent many photos and spoke with the person by 
      telephone and all sounded legit.&nbsp; They were&nbsp;told to wire money to a 
      Bank in Canada and once they did they were not able to reach the person 
      again.....&nbsp; apparently there is no car and these guys are&nbsp; 
      “OUT”&nbsp;a lot of money.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hindsight is always&nbsp;20/20 but it’s 
      possible for us to all learn from this and there are a few tips we want to 
      suggest.&nbsp; <br><b>1)</b> We really think you should always look at a 
      car before buying or at least have someone else look ... but if you don’t 
      want to go that way..<br><b>2)&nbsp;</b>“Google” the persons&nbsp;email address and 
      name and see if anything at all turns up<br><b>3</b>). We suggest that if 
      you are asked to wire money to any other foreign country&nbsp;(even Canada)&nbsp;you 
      be very wary.&nbsp;You may want to call the RCMP (Royal Canadian Mounted 
      Police)&nbsp;fraud unit and&nbsp;ask them for assistance and voice your concerns.<br><b>
      4</b>) We would suggest that whenever you are buying a car ... in USA or 
      not ... you tell the seller you want to arrange for an inspection by a 
      friend ....&nbsp;even if you don’t have someone ... you will learn a lot from 
      their reaction ... if they try to dissuade you ... then don’t do it... 
      something’s fishy. <br>5<b>)</b>&nbsp; We also suggest that you do not buy 
      from or sell to someone unless you can speak to them on a&nbsp;LAND LINE ... 
      not a cell phone.&nbsp;You can much more easily track down a land line phone 
      number.&nbsp;If you Google a phone number or go to&nbsp;411.com you can find out if 
      it’s a land line or a cell phone. <br><b>6</b>)&nbsp; We suggest that you 
      ask to have faxed or emailed to you,&nbsp;a copy of the persons Drivers License 
      and then try to verify that info.&nbsp; Experienced&nbsp;Crooks may get around 
      this with a phony but chances are they are not expecting you to ask for 
      this and may not have it.&nbsp;<br><b>7) </b>&nbsp; Get a physical address from 
      the person and Google it ... sometimes you can also get the phone numbers 
      of surrounding people or businesses... and if necessary do some 
      investigation before you send that money.<br><b>8)&nbsp;</b>If you are 
      suspicious .... don’t do it ... trust your instincts no matter how nice 
      the car.&nbsp; If you feel you have been victimized contact the 
      publication where you saw the vehicle.&nbsp; If this were to happen at 
      Hotrodhotline.com&nbsp;we would immediately step in and do all we could to 
      provide you with information that would help ....&nbsp;it is not our policy to 
      protect scammers or thieves in the name of “privacy”.</span></td>

      <span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">So&nbsp;the
old adage &#8230;.&nbsp;"If it sounds too good to be true&#8230;..&nbsp;It
is"&nbsp;is a good rule of thumb.&nbsp;Also,&nbsp;if anyone wants you
to give&nbsp;them money back when they buy your car or parts&#8230;.&nbsp;One
simple rule&nbsp; "DON"T"&nbsp; Let them work out whatever their
problem is themselves&#8230;.&nbsp;Now having said that&#8230;.&nbsp;We will list a
few of the scams we are aware of and give some links to places that may
be of some help if you should choose to pursue it..<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transfer
of Money when buying a car.&nbsp;&nbsp;Both buyers and sellers need to
know that a&nbsp;"Cashiers Check"&nbsp;is not as good as cash.&nbsp;
They can be stopped,&nbsp; they can be counterfeited,&nbsp; they can be
forged or changed to reflect a different amount than purchased
for.&nbsp;Unless you are very very&nbsp;confident of the person who is
giving you a cashiers check then you need to think about whether you
should accept one.&nbsp;&nbsp;You can no longer verify the validity of
a cashiers check by calling the bank that issued it &#8230;..&nbsp;You will
not know if it was real for several weeks.&nbsp;If accepting a cashiers
check you should be careful to validate the identity of the person
giving it to you &#8230;..&nbsp;It may be just fine but don't just accept a
cashiers check at face value&#8230;&nbsp;you could get
stung.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wire transfers are the safest method of
transfer that we know of,&nbsp;followed only by Western Union.&nbsp;In
both of these instances, actual cash must be available before the
transfer is made.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You do need to be wary of giving out
your banking information to people though. We have heard that some of
these scam artists are now saying they will wire money to people and
getting their banking numbers and somehow using the information to get
money from the account. You should always check with your banking
institution for advice on any type of transfer of funds or acceptance
of checks.&nbsp; They are the experts&#8230;. Not us. We would advise that
you NEVER give this type of information out by email or to anyone who
you cannot verify the identity of by phone, U.S. Mail, etc. Do not do
business with anyone who you cannot talk to and get a physical location
for .... if they are not willing to provide this information then they
have something to hide.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transportation
of Vehicles:&nbsp;&nbsp;If you hire a transport company to ship your
car, we would recommend that you check their records thoroughly.&nbsp;
We would recommend that you do not go with any company that has a
non-refundable deposit or who will not give you a delivery date in
writing.&nbsp; This includes the companies who advertise with us.&nbsp;
We do not check the credentials of our advertisers, but we will refuse
advertising and remove anyone who has had complaints lodged against
them with us and who we feel have not "made it right" with our
customers.&nbsp;We suggest that you check the Better Business Bureau in
the town where the company is located and also check the Department of
Transportation record for the company.&nbsp;Some companies change names
frequently to avoid bad reports so beware of a company that
is&nbsp;"new"&nbsp;as it may just have changed it's name.&nbsp;Get
references&#8230;. We think that personal references are a great way to check
out these companies.<br><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;This is the most common
scam for people selling cars and/or other goods either on the internet
or in newspapers&#8230;&nbsp;They send a message like this &#8230;..<br>Dear sir/Madam, <br>I
am an international business man, specialized in dealing, purchasing and
selling of autos. I also help my foreign client to ship there auto to
any place of there desired country or destination, most especially
Europe cause i have a shipper who takes care of the shippment, so
shipping will not pose any problem.<br>Presently i have a client who
has asked me to help him purchase an auto subjected above which will be
shipped to africa . As i was browsing through the internet, i saw your
advert and i will like to purchase it for my client, but before payment
will be made i need to be sure of who i will be dealing with if you are
going to be honest and sincere throughout the transaction. So to start
with, signify your interest by forwarding to me your last offer as well
as your method(s) of payment through the email, after which we can
continue with the transaction and i promise if all conditions and
agreement are accepted and reached on time, payment will be made out
almost immediately. hoping to here from you as soon as possible. <br>Respectfully, Charlton Heston.......&#8230;&nbsp; FOLLOWED UP&nbsp;WITH &#8230;.<br><br>Thanks for your urgent response. My Client 
      preferred mode of<br>payment is a cashiers check in united states dollars well the price offer<br>$2000 is okay by me but i will like you to include ($4500) this will<br>covers
my commission and the shipment fee bringing the total amount to $
6500&nbsp;which will be on your performa invoice. Be informed that I
have spoken with my client as regards the price and he has agreed to
make the payment , but before I give him the go ahead I want you to
assure me of sending the balance ($4,500) to my shipper through WESTERN
UNION MONEY TRANSFER immedaitely you recieve the payment from my client
since the payment will be made to you directly via cashiers check drawn
on U.S bank to enable me pay my shipping fees and arrange pick-up from
your location. Inview of the above, I want you to give me your word of
trust so that we can proceed with this transaction if you are okay with
my conditions.if this is okay by u get back to me with your Full Name,
Address and phone number which the check will be sent to. I await your
urgent response.<br>Respectfully,&nbsp; Charlton Heston<br><br>Sometimes
they say they are from another country&#8230;.&nbsp;But not all of them
are.&nbsp;This scam has been going on for a few years now but they
continue to bilk people.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Other Resources<br>Dept
of Transportation for info on specific Transport companies&nbsp;You can
enter the Name or DOT number of any company&nbsp;in the left margin.<br>Or&nbsp; Main Page&nbsp;Dept. of Transportation<br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buying
a car over a distance is done all the time, and in most cases it works
out fine &#8230;&#8230;&nbsp;but&#8230;.&nbsp;(there's that "but") there are some common
sense things you can do to keep your purchase from ending up
poorly.&nbsp; There is no substitution for&nbsp;you
PERSONALLY&nbsp;looking at and driving the car before you buy it.&nbsp;
We know that this is not always possible but would advise that you
have&nbsp;someone look at a car before you buy it.&nbsp;You can get an
appraisal or inspection by a professional.&nbsp; You could have a
friend or relative nearby go look at it.&nbsp;You could contact a club
or organization in the area of the car and see if someone affiliated
with them would look at the car for you.&nbsp;If you do decide to buy a
car without anyone looking at it you should at least get very very good
pictures and&nbsp;a video of the vehicle including sound with the
engine running.&nbsp;&nbsp;But no matter how good the pictures or video
there is no substitute for a personal inspection of some kind.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We hope that this has been of some help to you and given you some
resources and information for what&nbsp;may be a very large
transaction.&nbsp;We know that most people in our community are great
people but the big bad world out there does have some elements that are
out to defraud people and some of those people do infiltrate our
little&nbsp;niche from time to time.&nbsp;&nbsp; We have tried to
include information we thought would be helpful but really can't
pretend that we know of all of the schemes out there so please just
always be aware and do your homework before buying or selling your
vehicle.&nbsp;</span><br>&nbsp;</td>
