      <p><b>Please add Bill Mitrovich's 55' Gasser to the Lost &amp; Found. The car was sold in Northeast Ohio around 1977. Last believed to be seen in Conneaut, Ohio a few years ago. When we followed up on the tip, the car had already been resold and picked up.<br>

      Thank you&nbsp;<br>

      <p><b>I believe I&nbsp; owned Greg's car. The car originally belonged to
      Barnes &amp; Sperry.&nbsp; I purchased it &amp; did extensive work on the car to make it race worthy.
      If I had photos of the under side of the car I would know better. Dave
      Meal did front sub frame &amp; dropped axle installation. Mike &amp; Rocky
      Bellino  of Mr Gasket Co. did rear suspension (ladder bar) &amp; tilt  front end.
      Myles Enginering did motor destroked 302, fueler heads, Hilborn injection, m22 rock crusher.
      Sig Erson roller cam. The car ran as Lucky Charm in white pearl paint &amp; gold leaf lettering.
      I would greatly like to talk with Greg.&nbsp;</b></p>
      <p><b>Bill Mitrovich&nbsp;<br>
      The car ran either C or D/Gas at Dragway 42, Norwalk, Thompson and Presq.

      up.&nbsp; I received this about the 3rd week of October, 2002.&nbsp; In
      looking at the photos, there were a number of things that caught my eye
      and made me believe that it was a car that was already on the &quot;Lost
      and Found&quot; as a &quot;Found&quot; car.&nbsp; A few more emails and a
      phone call or two got the two parties together and it turns out that I was
      (for once!) correct.&nbsp; This is the same car that Greg Sy was looking
      for history on.&nbsp; I just love it when things work out!&nbsp; Click <a href="file:///C:/Users/Draglist/Documents/My Webs/gassermadness/lostandfound/found/sy/">HERE</a>
