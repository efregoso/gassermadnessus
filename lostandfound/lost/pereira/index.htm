        photographs and I was told the car was a IHRA ( Maybe NHRA not 100%sure) 
        stock class dragcar. It's a 1949 Oldsmobile 88. Not sure about the 
        engine but it could be a J2 Olds or a 56 V8 for a rocket 88 Oldsmobile. 
        The Name of the car and was painted on the roof above the door is &quot; 
        PA-SUM-HOL-LER &quot; The car was raced in the 60`s around 1965-1967 and the 
        car used to race in Houston TX until the car was sold for a couple 
        hundred in 1967/1968. That's the last to be know of the car. Here's more 
        details about the car. It was a blue paint job on it painted by Earl 
        Shine, the tires were supplied by Big 10 Tire Co, transmission was built 
        by Carters auto trans service, Spradlin supplied general auto parts and 
        Bowden's auto elect. did the electrical work. The interior had seat 
        covers over the torn and tattered seats, It had a stock 2 bbl carb that 
        was built by Joe Bowden and was running like a 4 bbl carb. Had slicks in 
        the back, 4 spd automatic hydramatic transmission built up by Carters 
        trans service. The car ran in the 13/14 second in the 1/4 mile from what 
        I have been told might be wrong or off. but I know the picture attached 
        was taken before the car was sold and it had a inspection sticker but 
        its on the passenger side which would mean it was in the 60`s early to 
        mid 60`s. I'm trying to locate what become of the car and for the most 
        recent pictures of the car or if its still around and if the owner would 
        want to sell it.</b><p align="center" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
        <b>I have some more information about the 49 Olds 88, it was a stock 
        class car, running 15.8`s in the 1/4 mile on a 15.7 class record.&nbsp; It 
        had seat covers over tattered seats.&nbsp; I talked to the original owner I 
        ran into him the other day and I wanted to update you more about the 
        vehicle in case you would want to update the lost &amp; found section<br>
