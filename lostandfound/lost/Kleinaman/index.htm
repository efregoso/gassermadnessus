		I was just told about your site and checked it out. I was wanting to 
		post a few pics in your lost and found area. My dad and I are trying to 
		locate is old dragcar. It ran at US 30 Dragstrip in the 60s and 70s. 
		Here are some pictures of the car. It was a 1964 Dodge Dart. The car had 
		a lot of changes made to it. As you can see from the pictures the driver 
		sat in the back seat, roof was cut off at the quarter pillars, the 
		engine was moved back to were the front seat would be and had a vinyl 
		cover snap on cover over it . It had a chromemoly straight front axle 
		under it. This car was ran almost every weekend at US 30 Dragstrip in 
		Indiana. The car was also street legal (lights all worked, had pipes to 
		put on it, and had to wear goggle when driving) and was used on the 
		street when they were not at the track. He ran this car from the mid 
		60's until the mid 70's before selling it. At the time he sold it he was 
		running a 440 in it. We are trying to locate the car again, or see if 
		anyone has any pics of it at the track running. The pictures I sent you 
		are all we have of the car now. the car ran in the yellow and black 
		color scheme first and in the 70's it went to the blue and black color 
		scheme<br>
		Thanks<br>
