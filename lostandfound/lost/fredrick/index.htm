          <b>I know its a long shot , but approx 5 years ago some fellas came up 
          from Kentucky and bought a 55 Chevy 2 door post off of me , it was 
          right after my son was born and i was desperately hurting for money 
          being out of work , it was just a red oxide 2 door post , when it left 
          here it had no dog house on it because i was going to drop a big block 
          in and it had crappy old steel wheels , i believe the gentlemen were 
          from the north west part of Kentucky , i would desperately like to 
          find this car again , if by chance you have any leads or would like a 
          picture of it let me know , I have a picture of it before it left , it 
          had a blue dash and a tan bench seat up front and a black painted rear 
          seat it has a 12 bolt 3:73 posi from a Chevelle in it , and the front 
          windshield had been replaced with a new one , the door panels were 
          crappy black naugahyde , and the carpeting was blue , the rear wheel 
          wells were not radiusd but they were cut higher up in a more squared 
          off pattern , and it had the factory 3spd that had been switched to 
          floor shift , again any help is greatly appreciated feel free to call 
          me at 217-827-6122<br>
          <br>
          Thank you kindly<br>
          Mac Fredrick<br>
