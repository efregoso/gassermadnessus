      <b>I have looked for my stepdad's old Willys ever since the guy he sold it 
      to in the 60's sold it to a guy in Indiana.....<wbr>I got a couple shots 
      of the car I'll try and dig up. anyway there was an article in Street 
      Rodder about the car in 84-85.the title of it was &quot;THE WANDERER&quot;...<wbr>the 
      car is bright yellow it's low and tubbed has a blown SBC in it and 40 ford 
      headlight trim......I'<wbr>d like to at least see if i can find the guy's 
      name and find out what became of the car....I have looked and for whatever 
      reason i am missing the issue I think is the one it is in....also I sent a 
      letter to them that got in the next issue with a pic of the gasser version 
      of the car it was titled &quot;the more things change the more they stay the 
      same&quot;, as the tell tale signs this was THAT car were it still had the same 
      straight axle though lowered, and the firewall was still the polished 
      aluminum one installed in the 60's it was notched in the center for the 
      mag......it also still had the polished dash insert with the SW gauges in 
      it. I have not got the money to buy it back&nbsp; If found but I'd almost 
      sell all my stuff to have it I am afraid though it may have gone the 
      billet route and be too far gone to reclaim. I am sure the car is still 
      around......<wbr>.BTW this is the first blown car I ever rode in it was 
      still a nosebleeder then though a street car the guy who owned it did a 
      two block long smoker sideways down my street!! I told him then (at 
      12years old!!) if he ever sold it I wanted a shot to buy it well of course 
      he didn't remember that later when he sold it and yeah who's gonna believe 
      a kid LOL!! anyway I know i am vague on the dates but please someone help 
      me here.......pics will follow when I find them. ERIK</b></td>
