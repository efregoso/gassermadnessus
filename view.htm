<b>Gasser Madness is obviously graphic intense. To get the full benefit
of the graphics (photos) here we suggest some viewing tips.</b></center>
<p>First and foremost, a<!--SELECTION-->
<!--/SELECTION-->
 good video card is a must for getting the full impact of <b>Gasser Madness</b>
or any site that has photos.</p>
<p><b>Windows Users:</b> &quot;Setting Colors&quot;. Click on <b>Start</b>,
click on <b>Settings</b>, chose <b>Control Panel</b>. Click on <b>Display</b>,
choose <b>Settings</b>. Choose <b>True Color (24 bit)</b> or <b>True Color (32
bit)</b>. While you're here, you might want to reset your &quot;Screen
Area&quot;. Windows default is 800 by 600 pixels. If you slide the arrow up to
1024 by 768 pixels and commit that setting you will gain desktop area and see a
lot more of every Webpage you visit. (If you're vision impaired, leave the
default). When done, you may have to readjust the contrast and brightness on
your monitor to suit your viewing taste.</p>

<b>AOL users:</b> AOL thinks they are doing you a favor by installing a graphics
limiter in their browser. True, graphics will load faster but they look
terrible. To see what the photos on <b>Gasser Madness</b> really look like
follow the steps below: </p>
<p>Click on <b>My AOL</b>, then click on <b>Preferences</b>, Click on <b>WWW</b>,
click on tab marked <b>Web Graphics</b>. Make sure the box marked &quot;use
compressed graphics&quot; is <b>not</b> selected, if there is a check mark in
the box, click on it to remove it and then click on <b>Apply</b> at the bottom
of the window.</p>
<p>Also under the <b>Preferences</b> section is a tab marked <b>Graphics</b>,
set maximum disk<br>
space to use for online art to <b>200 megabytes</b>.</p>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Since AOL has more problems than any other ISP - here
are some more tips for increasing its performance:</font></b></p>
<p>Below is a quick list of a few things every Windows and AOL user should do at
least once a month. If you like, you can print this, and keep it near your
computer. If you suspect that your computer may be experiencing some
difficulties, these steps should be run immediately. Detailed descriptions on
these maintenance procedures are included below.</p>
<p><b>A. EMPTY YOUR AOL CACHE<br clear="all">
B. &nbsp;BACK UP YOUR ADDRESS BOOK, FAVORITE PLACES AND PERSONAL FILING CABINETS<br clear="all">
C. CLEAN UP THE HARD DRIVE<br clear="all">
D. DEFRAGMENT YOUR HARD DRIVE<br clear="all">
E. RESOURCES ON AOL<br clear="all">
F. RESOURCES &amp; UPDATES AT MICROSOFT.COM</b></p>
<p><b>A. EMPTY YOUR AOL CACHE</b></p>
<p>NOTE: Sometimes browsing the web gets a little sluggish. Deleting the web
cache or stored files can make a big difference. Below are the steps on how to
do that. Remember that you can do all of this through the toolbar at the top of
the AOL screen.</p>
<p>1. Click on MY AOL on the AOL toolbar, then select PREFERENCES.<br>
2. Select WWW from the options in the sidebar on the left (it's the second from
the top).<br>
3. Click on DELETE FILES, located on the right side of the preferences window,
then click on OK.</p>
<p>NOTE: Although you may see the spinning beach ball for a few seconds, if
there are many files being deleted, you may not see any obvious signs of
activity. Rest assured, it is working.</p>
<p><b>B. BACKING UP YOUR ADDRESS BOOK, FAVORITE PLACES AND PERSONAL FILING
CABINETS</b></p>
<p>NOTE: The Organize folder contains all the Address Book entries, Favorite
Places, and Personal Filing Cabinet (PFC) information. If you make a copy of the
Organize folder, and save it somewhere other than the AOL Folder, you can always
restore your Address Book, Favorite Places and PFC should the originals develop
any problems. You can also put a copy of the Organize folder on a disk and move
it to a new computer.</p>
<p>1. Double-click on your My Computer icon.<br>
2. Double-click on the C: Drive.<br>
3. Double-click on the AMERICA ONLINE folder.<br>
4. Single-click on the Organize folder to highlight it, click on EDIT on the
menu, then select COPY.<br>
5. Click on EDIT on the menu, then select PASTE.<br>
NOTE: This will make a folder called Copy of Organize, which will contain
backups of the files you need. It will also contain copies of several database
files, which can get rather large, and are automatically created by the AOL
software. Continue with the steps below to remove them.<br>
6. Double-Click on the Copy of Organize folder.<br>
7. Click the folder named Cache.<br>
8. Click on File on the menu, then select Delete and answer Yes.<br>
NOTE: Now you can move the &quot;Copy of Organize&quot; folder to a safe place
such as the desktop, or ZIP disk.<br>
8. Close all open windows by clicking on the X in the upper right hand corner of
each window.</p>
<p><b>C. CLEAN UP THE HARD DRIVE</b></p>
<p>All sorts of programs place files on your hard drive. Some are temporary
files a program neglected to clean up, others are copies and logs of changes
made to your system by programs such as Scandisk, and still others accumulate as
you surf the Internet. What do you do with all these files?</p>
<p>Windows 98 has a wonderful applet called the Disk Cleanup Utility. This
utility, found in the Start/Accessories/System Tools folder, will help you rid
your hard drive of useless space wasting files. The applet is configurable and
will let you specify standard types of files it should delete, such as .TMP,
.OLD, .BKU, or any file type you supply. It will also clear your Internet cache.</p>
<p>NOTE: For Advanced Users - the advanced feature ties into the system,
allowing you to remove unwanted Windows component and to uninstall applications
that have registered themselves with Uninstall routines. With the Disk Cleanup
Utility, finding needed disk space will be a snap.&nbsp; If you aren't sure
about what you're removing...DON'T remove it!</p>
<p><b>D. DEFRAGMENT YOUR HARD DRIVE<br>
</b>Disk Defragmenter rearranges files, storing each file in a block of
contiguous space on the hard drive, thus improving read and write time to the
disk. You can use Disk Defragmenter with any hard drive or floppy disk that is
attached to your system. You can even use the Disk Defragmenter with hard drives
that have been compressed with DriveSpace.</p>
<p>To defragment your hard drive:<br>
1. Open My Computer and right-click the icon for the drive you want to
defragment.<br>
2. Choose Properties from the shortcut menu.<br>
3. In the Properties dialog box, click the Tools tab.<br>
4. Click Defragment Now.</p>
<p>Disk Defragmenter looks at your drive and tells you what percentage of its
space is currently fragmented. If the percentage is low, the program lets you
know that you don't need to bother defragmenting at this time. Of course, you
can go ahead and defragment anyway if you want to.</p>

<p>Now that you've jumped through more of AOLs hoops, here's another tip. Find
another ISP. Every area has several reliable hassle free ISPs who will give you
great service without the con. Yep, AOL is probably the greatest fraud ever
perpetrated on the web surfing American public. Their #1 - absolute function is
information gathering. Your name, credit card yada yada. They make a TON of
money not only selling your information but also bombarding you with all those
irritating ads etc. The browser they use is Internet Explorer (IE) - yep, good
old Bill Gates. They have no stand alone programming. Do yourself a huge favor
and stop being a sheep. Check out your local ISPs.</p>

<p>If DSL, cable or wireless modems are available in your area we suggest you
lose your archaic phone modem and step up to high performance web surfing. With
DSL for example, by the time you look at the first photo on a <b>Gasser Madness</b>
page, read the caption, all of the other images will already be loaded. You'll
kick yourself for not getting high speed internet sooner!</p><center>
