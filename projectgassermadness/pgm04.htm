            <b>Byron:<br>
            <br>
            In late June I drove back to Chuck Finder's shop in Ohio to pick up 
            the Gasser Madness Willys Pickup project gasser chassis. En route 
            there I was towing a rust free, 56 Chevy 2-dr wagon that Chuck will 
            transform into a dream ride. It will have a blown SBC under the hood 
            with Chuck's patented triple two barrels street induction system. I 
            think you can see Chuck's pleasure with the car. I've named it 
            Workhorse!<br>
            <br>
            Larry Sikora, Chuck's assistant who did the fabrication and welding 
            on the chassis is next to Chuck in one of the pictures. Chuck said, 
            &quot;Without Larry, the Willys couldn't have been built.&quot; I'm grateful 
            that two of the best minds in the building of a chassis for a gasser 
            style car worked on the Gasser Madness Project Car. Without them, it 
            wouldn't have been done to the high level of quality and safety that 
            it is, combined with an adherence to the design and style of the 
            period it's meant to reflect: the transitional era when gassers were 
            evolving into funny cars.<br>
            <br>
            You will also catch a glimpse of some of the wonderful cadre of 
            Chuck's friends who helped load the Willys for its trip to 
            California. The yellow primer coupe is the Traveler car replica that 
            Chuck is now working on with Hank Whittmore; again, Larry is 
            involved in that too. Another of Chuck's great friends, &quot;Big Al&quot; 
            Teal is dropping a blown BBC into the Gasser Madness chassis for the 
            ride to California. The actual race motor for the Willys will be an 
            unblown but injected BBC. Mark Nichols is giving Chuck a hand 
            installing spindles on the Traveler.<br>
            <br>
            One photo shows the &quot;California Willys Express&quot; stopped in Gallup, 
            New Mexico. The pickup and motor are tarped in green and I tossed in 
            one of Chuck's beautiful chopped 33 coupe bodies for a friend back 
            in California.<br>
            <br>
            The photo with the tarp pulled back shows Art and Ralph Foster 
            admiring Chuck and Larry's work on the chassis. The &quot;Willys Express&quot; 
            had just arrived at Art's shop, Foster Engines. in Santa Maria. Art 
            has already squeezed his son A. J. into the driver's seat so he's 
            unseen in this photo but A. J. will be doing the driving.<br>
            <br>
            The photo of the pickup with the front fenders and hood mocked on 
            was taken yesterday at George Wuethrich's Lightning Auto Body in 
            Santa Maria. George has already formed the aluminum for the pickup 
            bed and now he's at work on finishing the body work. George will 
            also do the paint. In the upper RH corner of that photo you can see 
            the roof of George's own 33 pickup. That will be a very nice early 
            Hemi powered Willys. Our goal is to attend the Gasser Reunion next 
            year with both cars.<br>
            <br>
            Thanks as always for your fantastic website.<br>
