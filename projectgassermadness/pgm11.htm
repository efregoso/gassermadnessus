            Byron, here are some pit shots of Project Gassermadness at LACR, 
            Saturday, 02-24-07.<br>
            <br>
            This was an intial test and tune outing. We're trying to get the car 
            ready for racing at the March Meet in two weeks. All systems worked 
            perfectly except the fuel delivery off idle. The car would not 
            launch hard. Burnouts were spectacular, top end was too, but Art 
            thinks the idle system is draining away too much fuel when a load is 
            applied, so we're going to recalibrate the idle system before next 
            weekend. This coming Friday and Saturday we'll take it too Famoso 
            for testing again if weather permits.<br>
            <br>
            The crew was as follows:<br>
            <br>
            Art Foster: crew chief and engine builder Randy Foster: driver<br>
            Ralph Foster: crew, driver's assistant, safety John Sarena: crew, 
            saftey<br>
            <br>
            Chuck Finders was present too by proxy, because I was on the phone 
            with him several times during the day. Chuck will be at the March 
            Meet.<br>
            <br>
            By the way, those orange streamers are functional:<br>
            <br>
            1. they warn onlookers of the sharp, easily bent tips of the 
            spoiler's fins.<br>
            2. we want to see how they stream out as the car goes down the 
            strip. <br>
            <br>
            Hope all is well, sorry there are no action shots, one of the other 
            crew members as some that I'll try and send, but my crew job didn't 
            allow me to shoot any.<br>
