            Pickup.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As you can see,
            it&#8217;s a complete vehicle and remarkably intact for being 63 years
            old and never restored.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
            odometer reads 89,000+ miles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I&#8217;m
            going to try and start the motor sometime down the road&#8230;or perhaps
            I should say &#8220;strip&#8221; since I don&#8217;t intend to make this a
            street driven vehicle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
            motor, as the photo reveals, is complete: possibly this could have
            been one of those oft heard yarns of &#8220;we dropped a battery in it,
            added gas, and drove it home.&#8221;</b></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><b>&nbsp;I heard of the car through a fellow
            car nut in this area, followed up on the lead, and made a deal with
            the owner who I&#8217;ve known for some years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>I just didn&#8217;t know he&#8217;d picked up this car.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>In the end, I traded one gasser for another.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>The car I traded was a 55 Chevy, straight axle, fiberglass
            tilt front end, ex-drag car that I&#8217;d planned to restore.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>But since I have one of those already, it made sense to go
            after this Willys.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I&#8217;ve
            always wanted a 37-39 Willys with the &#8220;Snoopy&#8221; front end.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Drag dreams do come true if you&#8217;re patient.</b></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><b>&nbsp;The history I&#8217;ve been given on the
            car is that it came out of Northern California.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>The fellow I bought it from had taken it down to the Pomona
            Swap Meet to sell, had no luck, brought it back to this area, and
            that&#8217;s when I made contact with him.</b></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><b>&nbsp;I like the fact that it had not been a
            drag car previously.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Its
            history will evolve as it&#8217;s built and raced.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>I also like that Chuck Finders will be building the chassis.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>His involvement creates sort of an &#8220;instant gasser
            history&#8221; for the car; a connection to the past and also with the
            present.</b></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><b>&nbsp;I&#8217;ve a name for the car, but for now
            just have it referred to as the &#8220;GasserMadness Project Willys&#8221;.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span><i><font color="#FF0000">[Dave told me his name for
            the car, but it's pretty cool and one I've not seen before.&nbsp; I
            would hate to spill it and have someone else &quot;borrow&quot; the
            name before he gets to use it, so you'll just have to wait to see
            what it is!&nbsp; Byron]</font></i></b></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><b>&nbsp;I&#8217;ve gotten many unexpected comments
            on the car.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This week I
            had it weighed to complete the registration, and an old timer
            (meaning older than me, and I&#8217;m 58) who was at the agricultural
            scale here in Lompoc came over, walked around it and then said
            &#8220;You didn&#8217;t see many of these even back in the thirties, but
            every time one came down the road it caught your attention because
            of the front end and headlights.&#8221;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Once he learned I was going to turn it into a drag car he was
            disappointed.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Well, that&#8217;s the way it goes, &#8220;Us crazy kids cutting up
            and ruining a good Willys.&#8221;</b></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><b>My first act of &#8220;cutting up&#8221; will be to
            remove the cab and ship it back to Chuck.</b></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><b>&nbsp;By the &#8220;weigh&#8221;. It weighed
            1940 lbs as you see it, and Chuck Finders told me the shipping
            weight was just over 2000 lbs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>This lacks windows, water in the radiator, seats, and a
            tailgate, so the cars weight shows how intact it still is.</b></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><b>&nbsp;Present this as you see fit.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>It may be one of the first &#8220;Project Cars&#8221; in cyberspace.</b></p>
