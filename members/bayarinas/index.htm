      done all of the work so far, is in the foreground. My Father is at the 
      driver's door, while I am towards the rear of the car. Thanx again for 
      adding the pics Byron, I appreciate it! Vince B.</b></td>

      today, aside from magnesium Halibrands. Here is a quick rundown: Steel 
      body, doors, and deck. Glass boards and fenders. Stock frame, boxed w/ 
      extra crossmembers and a cage. Stock front axle on 2 inch over springs. 9&quot; 
      Ford rear, 3:50 gearset on a 4-link. Blown 454 and a TH-400 tranny.</b></td>

      <b>Hi Byron. Here is the last pic. It was taken in the pits at Island 
      Dragway. This was the only time the car has been to the track. It ran 13.0 
      at 106. It spun the tires all of 1st gear, then skipped 2nd and dropped 
      into 3rd. That's with a 3:50 gear in it! With a tranny that actually 
      shifts and a little traction, it would surely be an 11-second car. We've 
      decided not to play with the Chev. We're going to leave it on the street 
      and build the Willys strictly for the track. We hope to go 10.0s at least. 
      Thanx again Byron! Vince B.</b></td>
