      (pretty much) at Cherry street beach in Long Beach, CA. The small block 
      keeps me out of trouble...<br>
      Thanks, I will also send my work horse Shortened Elk...it now has a 5 inch 
      longer wheelbase, aside from being 30 inches shorter in length. I used a 
      GMC 1/2 ton front end clip...and a 3/4 ton rear end...I was going to make 
      it into a 5th wheel hauler at first, but now hate to drive long 
      distances...get too tired..just gettin old I guess..hehe<br>
      <br>
      Byron,<br>
      This is Ted Brown, I used to also be in partnership with Chuck Finders 
      (Finders and Brown) way back then, for about 3 years or so. Then I went on 
      my own...I then had a Hotrod/Chassis shop in Orange Co. called &quot;Ted Brown 
      Chassis&quot; I also build a lot of A Gas Supercharged cars back then..plus a 
      lot of Roadsters and Coupes and just about anything else that people 
      needed.<br>
      I did race car work for... Stone Woods and Cook, K.S. Pittman, JR 
      Thompson, Hamberis and Mitchell from Frisco...MGM-C &amp; O Hydro AG/S Austin 
      pickup, Hubert Platt had the Georgia Shaker, Doug's Headers Chevy 2 Much, 
      Corvette Auto parts Funny Corvette, Steve Montrelli's funny Firebird, Al 
      Van Der Woude's Flying Dutchman Funny, and lots more that I have forgotten 
      at the moment...CRS is what you get when you get old..hehe &quot;Can't Remember 
      S*#T&quot;!! hehe really not so funny when you want to remember what you were 
      doing. Sometimes I stand at the tool box and wonder what I went there for, 
      lately.. I think that is the main reason I retired...<br>
      Anyway, I will read what your Group has to say about the old days with 
      interest...<br>
      And see if I have any pics that were not printed, and maybe a few that 
      were so people that are getting interested in the sport now days, can see 
      some of the older stuff and ideas from back then...I was lucky to have had 
      customers that pretty much gave me a free hand at building their race 
      cars, and they were very successful with their racing, back in those 
      days...<br>
      All the little guys were really fun to help back then, they could not 
      afford a complete car, like the people with money behind them..so a &quot;few 
      hints to them&quot; helped them do a lot better with their endeavors..<br>
      thanks again, Ted Brown</b></td>
