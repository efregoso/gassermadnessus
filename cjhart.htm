<h1>Gone Racin’…To say goodbye to C.J. Hart</h1>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt">It is inevitable in racing, 
that we must bid farewell to our friends and heroes.&nbsp; July 1, 2004, we paid our 
respects to one of the greats of auto racing, C.J. Hart.&nbsp; His full name was 
Cloyce Hart, and he took the name Joe in an attempt to hide from an angry 
father.&nbsp; C.J. became his name and he was a paradox for us.&nbsp; A kind and fatherly 
type of man, he could also set standards and refuse to cross the line.&nbsp; Born in 
1911, he ran away to join the circus, came west with his bride, best friend and 
fellow car racer, Mary Margaret “Peggy” Hart.&nbsp; They formed a team that could not 
be broken, even by Peggy’s untimely death in 1980.&nbsp; C.J. was affectionately 
called Pappy, and for good reason, for most of the racers were at least a decade 
his junior.&nbsp; Hart worked in a gas station, then left to form a garage with a 
friend in Santa Ana.&nbsp; The depression in the 1930’s was hard.&nbsp; Hard on men and 
hard on their families, but C.J. and Peggy found a way to raise a family and 
still do what they loved to do, and that was race cars.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" align="left" style="text-align: left">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" align="left" style="text-align: left">Hart was eager to 
stop illegal street racing among the young men after World War II, and get the 
kids off the streets.&nbsp;&nbsp; He and two friends, Creighton Hunter and Frank Stillwell 
got permission from the authorities to open a dragstrip on an old abandoned 
airstrip that has since become John Wayne Airport in Orange County, California.&nbsp; 
Pappy literally had to invent the rules for drag racing.&nbsp; His track was not the 
first, because a club had formed a race at Goleta in 1949, but Hart was the 
first to charge admission and to consistently award prizes and trophies and to 
codify the rules.&nbsp; He decided on a quarter mile distance after watching the 
quarter horses run at horse tracks.&nbsp; A quarter mile distance also allowed plenty 
of room for stopping the cars.&nbsp; Running a drag strip turned into a lifetime 
avocation and &nbsp;&nbsp;Hart created a venue, and a system that was copied by people 
from all over the country.&nbsp; People came out to the West Coast to observe this 
new racing phenomena, and then went home to start up timing associations, as 
they were called, in nearly every part of the country.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" align="left" style="text-align: left">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" align="left" style="text-align: left">Distinctly 
American, this sport has grown and prospered.&nbsp; Sanctioning bodies formed to 
carry on what Hart had started and over time the rules were</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" align="left" style="text-align: left">modified and became 
the sport of Drag Racing as we know it today.&nbsp; Pappy went on to run drag strips 
at Lions in Long Beach, Famoso Raceway, north of Bakersfield, and worked at many 
other tracks in Southern California.&nbsp; Upon retirement, he went to work for Steve 
Gibbs and NHRA with their Safety Safari Team, which is the group responsible for 
the safety of the drivers on the track.&nbsp; He may have retired again, but it is 
hard to tell, because Pappy was always at a race, a reunion or a drag racing 
event.&nbsp; It is also impossible to tell all the stories about Pappy.&nbsp; Drag racing 
and the people in his life were everything to him.&nbsp; </p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" align="left" style="text-align: left">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" align="left" style="text-align: left">He always had a 
cigar in his hand and a wispy smile on his face, just barely visible.&nbsp; He could 
chide and admonish someone who had broken the rules with such warmth and humor, 
that no one ever took offense.&nbsp; He was terse.&nbsp; His advice was short and to the 
point.&nbsp; When someone was losing a fight, he blurted out the sage help, “don’t 
get up, dummy.”&nbsp; When he caught someone breaking the rules, he would say 
“Cheater, don’t do it again.”&nbsp; Years later he would see the same guy and greet 
him with the words, “hello, cheater.” &nbsp;Once he was cajoled and nagged into 
taking a trip to Hawaii. &nbsp;He gave in, and went with the group, but upon landing 
in Honolulu, and taking one look around, went immediately back into the terminal 
and boarded another plane to come home.&nbsp; When asked about his trip to Hawaii, he 
exclaimed that if they tried to put one more lei around his neck he would 
strangle them.&nbsp; C.J.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" align="left" style="text-align: left">was a no nonsense 
kind of guy.&nbsp; He knew what he wanted and he kept focused on that goal.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" align="left" style="text-align: left">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" align="left" style="text-align: left">It had been 24 
years since he lost his best friend and wife, Peggy.&nbsp; She was every bit the 
competitor that Pappy was.&nbsp; She was his right arm and confidant.&nbsp; She was a 
tenacious race car driver and drove on the drag strip and at the dry lakes.&nbsp; 
Peggy did not like to be beaten.&nbsp; Pappy gave her the best car that he could, and 
Peggy drove it to victory after victory.&nbsp; C.J. always said that he was just 
biding his time until the Good Lord came to take him away to be with his darling 
wife.&nbsp; Pappy was 93 and said that he had a full and good life.&nbsp; He liked to joke 
with his friend, Wally Parks, close in age and equal in zeal for the sport of 
drag racing, that one or the other of them could remember Adam.&nbsp; They traded age 
jokes all the time.&nbsp; Pappy was an honored guest at all the reunions; the CHRR in 
Famoso, CRA, Car Racers Reunion, Bean Bandits, Gas-Up Party and many more.&nbsp; He 
was inducted into several Hall of Fames, and no doubt will be added to more as 
the years go by.&nbsp; His greatness came not only from his idea to create a sport 
that would get kids off the street, but his leadership with those kids, who 
would follow him anywhere.&nbsp; His famous quote was always, “But you got in free.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" align="left" style="text-align: left">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" align="left" style="text-align: left">A person’s funeral 
is often the measure of the man himself.&nbsp; Those in attendance were some of the 
very young people that looked up to him, and then went on to glories of their 
own.&nbsp; I saw Dale Pulde, Linda Vaughn, Gloria and Cindy Gibbs, Wally Parks, Sam 
Jackson, Dick Wells, Jerry Archambeault, Bob Muravez, or as we came to know him, 
“Floyd Lippincott Jr,” Reverend Ken Owens, Reverend Scrub Hansen, Jack 
Underwood, Ron</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" align="left" style="text-align: left">Henderson, Orah Mae 
Millar, Pete’s widow, and her family, Doug Kruse, Louie Senter, Bob Leggio, 
Mousie Marcellus, Creighton and Betty Hunter, John Ewald, Dave Wallace Jr, Tommy 
Ivo, Donny Johansen, Hila Paulsen Sweet, Andy and Ron Marocco, Neil Britt, John 
McClenathan from the Bean Bandits, Big John Hunt, and many more.&nbsp; We will miss 
Pappy but he set us straight when he said, very simply, &quot;I’m ready, it’s been a 
great ride, and I have no regrets.”</p>
