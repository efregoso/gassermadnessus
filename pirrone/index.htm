    <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;Joe Pirrone started 
    racing back in the mid 1950’s. His first races were mainly on the streets of 
    Philadelphia. When drag strips started popping up, Joe made a name for 
    himself as a tough competitor who always had clean appearing cars. </p>
    <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;Joe’s thirst for speed 
    pushed him into the ranks of the supercharged gas coupes. Later he would 
    learn the tricks to running Nitro helping out on some local top fuel cars. 
    Even though Joe loved the speed of the dragsters his first love were the 
    supercharged coupes.</p>
    <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;Joe became famous for his 
    work on the automatic transmission. He made a special band release that made 
    the four-speed Hydro a safer transmission. Later he would help engineer the 
    Torqueflite to be able to withstand the high horse power of blown gas and 
    Nitro engines. Joe’s company Boss Hydro located in Philadelphia had many 
    national record holding customers. </p>
    <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;Joe’s engineering skills 
    were well complimented by his abilities of being a superb craftsman. Joe 
    built numerous beautiful race cars over his 40 plus years in racing. His 
    life spanned the early days of drag racing and later the Nostalgia racing 
    that we all love today.&nbsp; </p>
    <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;He was also well known 
    for helping anyone who needed a hand. He worked on many of his customers and 
    friends engines and chassis to help make them as fast as possible.</p>
    <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align:justify">Joe was also an 
    accomplished artist who loved painting and played numerous musical 
    instruments. </p>
    <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align:justify">Joe was an outstanding 
    father and business man. His company Joe Pirrone Transmission is still in 
    business today. Joe was a great teacher who was always willing to share his 
    knowledge with others.</p>

          appeared regularly at Acto, Vargo, Englishtown, Maple Grove and Cecil 
          County.&nbsp; Joe competed at the 67 Nationals at Indy in the AA/GS class. 
          This car raced against the top gassers of the day, K.S. Pittman, Jr. 
          Thompson, the Hill Bros. and many more. The Boss Hydro utilized a 
          boxed Willys frame expertly done by Joe Pirrone. The Oldsmobile rear 
          end used 4:56 gears. The front axle was fabricated by Don Long . Power 
          came from a 392 Chrysler Hemi with a 6-71 supercharger.&nbsp; Transmission 
          was a Boss Hydro TorqueFlite. The Willys featured a full leather
