        <td width="100%"><b>Street racing has been around about as long as there 
        have been streets.&nbsp; Whether it was horses, carriages or later, 
        cars, people have raced since day one.&nbsp; while I do NOT condone 
        street racing, I can't say that, as a kid, I never took part...few can.&nbsp; 
        Many stories have arisen about street racing back in the 50's, 60's, 
        70's, and even the 80's.&nbsp; There's even been some movies...<i>Hot 
        Rod</i>, <i>The California Kid</i>, <i>American Graffiti</i>, and 
        many others including the recent <i>Fast and Furious</i> movies.</b><p>
        <b>Stories I've heard over the years have all sorts of endings.&nbsp; 
        Some have been funny, some serious, and a few have been downright 
        tragic.&nbsp; Fortunately, there's no tragic ones here.&nbsp; I hope you 
        enjoy them and, if you have a story to share, send it to me at 
        <a href="mailto:gassermadness@draglist.com?subject=Street Stories">
        gassermadness@draglist.com</a>.&nbsp; 
        I'm not interested in current stuff.&nbsp; The stories should be at 
        least 15 or 20 years old.&nbsp; That will show that you matured enough 
        to live through it, and it also precludes the rice rockets of today.</b></td>

              <b>Back in the mid and late'60s, San Francisco was going through 
              &nbsp;a huge revolution. If you were truly cool you were trading horse 
              power for flower power. Thank goodness a lot of us&nbsp; just weren't 
              going down that easy. I had a sweet '55&nbsp; Chevy post. It ran a 
              301,&nbsp; fi heads, 4speed and 4:56s.It was fast but by no means the 
              fastest. 426 Roadrunners, Holman and Moody built Fords, Andy Brizo 
              built 409s&nbsp;just to name a few ,were&nbsp;all there.&nbsp;We had three main 
              street racing spots, NBC mountain, The Great Highway and 
              Brotherhood way .Brotherhood&nbsp;was my favorite. It actually had a1/4 
              mile&nbsp;start and finish &nbsp;line on the street. A church parking lot 
              was conveniently&nbsp;&nbsp;located at the finish line ,so if you wanted&nbsp;, 
              that was a great place to hang and see who won. One night a 
              motorcycle cop was in hot pursuit of two of the fastest cars and 
              wasn't able to catch either one. He comes back to the parking lot 
              at the finish line and proceeds to give about a dozen of us that 
              were out of our cars a ticket for watching a drag race. One of the 
              guys in our group says to the cop &quot;I hope you fall off your 
              motorcycle.&quot; Another&nbsp;had no license&nbsp;and told the cop &quot;what are you 
              going to do, take away my legs if i don't pay your fine?&quot; That was 
              actually the only time I can ever remember being ticketed by the 
              cops.&nbsp;Once a guy had a full blown rail and the cops&nbsp;gave him a 
              ticket for no headlights. They were usually real cool.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;.</div>

            <b>&nbsp;&nbsp; I grew up in the little town of Wells, in Central Southern

            lives;&nbsp; girls, parties, and cars!&nbsp; (Not necessarily in that order, 
            either)&nbsp; Most of the guys I hung around with were into Chevy 
            muscle.&nbsp; Camaros, Chevelles, and Nova&nbsp;SS's, and lots of Tri-5's.&nbsp; 
            Those 55-57's&nbsp;were cheap and plentiful back then.&nbsp; One car I had was 
            a 57 150 2-door sedan purchased from a junkyard with no engine or 
            trans for $75.00.&nbsp; Dropped in a screamin' 283 bored out to 301, 
            full-race Isky cam, big ole' 4-barrel and a 4-speed.&nbsp; Went racing in 
            Mankato and Albert Lea on weekends, very seldom got beat, but there 
            were a few times.&nbsp; But the one race that really sticks out was when 
            I had a 55 2-door sedan, bought for $30.00 from a gas station in New 
            Richland, MN.&nbsp; I painted it Corvette yellow&nbsp;and dropped in &nbsp;a warmed 
            over 327/4-speed.&nbsp; The car was quick and had a reputation to 
            uphold.&nbsp; One Friday nite, me and Wayne and Mike&nbsp;were&nbsp;cruisin' the 
            3-blocks long main drag in Wells looking for some local action, 
            whether it be involving cars,&nbsp;chicks,&nbsp;a good beer party, or a 
            combination of all three.&nbsp; Suddenly there's a strange car in town 
            with a couple guys looking for&nbsp;&quot;that yellow 55&quot;.&nbsp; Come to find out 
            they're from Albert Lea and they want to go racin'.&nbsp; They're&nbsp;in a 
            nice looking 64 Impala SS, so we figure that's the car they're 
            runnin'.&nbsp; Doesn't take long, word travels FAST in 3 blocks, there's 
            gonna be a race out on the Freeborn Road, a nice new blacktop that 
            runs straight east out of town to Freeborn, MN.&nbsp; It runs straight as 
            an arrow&nbsp;for about 5 miles to the 1st curve.&nbsp; </b>

          <div>
            <b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of the good ole' boys from Wells had painted some white 
            lines exactly 1320 feet apart on that nice new road.&nbsp; It had been 
            the local Friday nite drag strip for years before that&nbsp;when we were 
            still riding bicycles.&nbsp; </b>

          <div>
            <b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Pretty soon the main drag in town is almost deserted and 
            there's about 50 cars parked on the gravel road at the &quot;starting 
            line&quot;.&nbsp; There's also a beat-up old pickup pulling a trailer with a 
            rusty, beat-up 57 Chevy 4-door sedan on it, nobody knows who it 
            belongs to.&nbsp; We're starting to wonder &quot;what the hell&quot; when that 64 
            Impala drives up to the trailer, one guy gets out, jumps into the 
            57, and fires it up.&nbsp; Needless to say, it wasn't what it looked 
            like.&nbsp; That 4-door pulls up to the line next to me and the driver 
            says &quot;let's GO!&quot;&nbsp; The engine in that car sounded like a NASTY 
            big-block, especially running right out of the headers, and me with 
            a small-block and stock exhaust through the mufflers.&nbsp;&nbsp; I guess it 
            was an ego thing, I couldn't back down with all those friends 
            watching, so we ran 3 times and he blew my doors off 3 times.&nbsp; Good 
            thing (for me) there was no cash involved.&nbsp; That's when the cops 
            showed up and&nbsp;everyone scattered,&nbsp;except those Albert Lea guys, 
            they&nbsp;couldn't leave because they were trying to load that 57 back 
            onto the trailer in a hurry.&nbsp; Us locals&nbsp;sneaked back into town and 
            the guy with the 57 got tickets for illegal racing and no exhaust.&nbsp; 
            So we had the last laugh anyway, the cops&nbsp;suspected but couldn't 
            prove who the other&nbsp;racer was.&nbsp; The guy with the 57 could have 
            ratted me out, but he didn't.&nbsp; I saw him later that summer and found 
            out what he was running in that 57.&nbsp; It was a&nbsp;&quot;full-race&quot; 
            427/4-speed that he had just built for his 66 Chevelle drag car.&nbsp; He 
            and his buddies stuck the engine into that ole' 57 just to test it 
            out on us poor&nbsp;country boys.&nbsp; </b>

            us hot-rodders out on the highway, because the Sheriff drove a red 
            '69 GTO Judge, one deputy had a blue '67 427 Impala SS, and the 
            other deputy drove a red '67 Olds 442.&nbsp;&nbsp;These 3 cars all had the 
            police badging on the doors and red lights on the roofs.&nbsp; We 
            respected those cars and very seldom got a ticket when they were

          makes his car VERY fast. Sure Cecil, you haven't seen&nbsp;Tokens car yet. 
          OK.... so that night, Token has the high school hottie with him and 
          picks us up downtown&nbsp;to&nbsp;hang a few U'ez on main street...and here 
          comes Cecil. I'm gonna tell ya, back then it didn't take&nbsp;NOTHIN to get 
          a drag race goin, and fortified by a couple brewskies I hollar over to 
          Cecil...&quot;327&quot; and give him a thumbs down.&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh BOY!!! Next thing ya 
          know were headin south outta town and onto Hiway 131, our very own 
          late night drag strip... flat, straight, wide,&nbsp;with two county 
          roads&nbsp;that cross it exactly 1/4 mile apart. We get on down to the 
          start line and turn the cars around and line them up to head back 
          towards town for the race. I hollar over again to Cecil that the 
          mighty 396 is gonna eat him up. He shrugs his shoulders&nbsp;and says 
          &quot;We'll see&quot;... We start the count down from the back seat of that 56 
          hardtop, theres four or five of us in Tokens car and just Cecil in 
          his. Three! two! one! GO!!!&nbsp; Man oh man!&nbsp; ya had to been there...Cecils 
          car lifts up a few inches and the tires are just boiling! and we're 
          doing the same thing! But we're both accelerating like a sumbitch, 
          heavy load and all, then Token goes for a power shift to second. Son 
          of a bitch! Token misses second! and I have my first opportunity of 
          hearing a HIGH winding big block. Man oh man Token, what a rush. OK...nothin 
          hurt to bad...we pull over and Cecil comes back around to check us 
          out. &quot;We're good!&quot; Token hollars out, &quot;Lets go again!&quot;&nbsp; ALRIGHT!!!! 
          We're gonna SMOKE Cecil this time!&nbsp; OK... so we line up again, the 
          count starts down again, and son of a bitch!...d'eja' vue...the 
          engines scream, the cars lift, the tires boil, and Token misses 
          second..again. This time, Cecil keeps on goin into town, Token finally 
          finds second, or third, and we limp on into town. About now the beer 
          is gone, we're whipped, it's late...Token drops us off by the grocery 
          store and the line to the oil gauge starts to spew oil onto the 
          engine. We get out and honest to god, my final vision of that hot rod 
          chevy was of Token and the babe heading towards his place, oil smoke 
          still billowing from under the hood. We never did find out what the 
          mighty 396 would have done&nbsp;against Cecils homebrewed 327. The 
          girl...she came back to town about 30 years later...weighing about a 
          hundred pounds more. That $15 Chevy...the day I got married I watched 
          my pals push it down the alley from my place....and I never&nbsp;did get 
          paid.</b></div>

        <b>I was fortunate enough to come of age at a time in the early 70s when 
        it seemed every&nbsp;socially minded&nbsp;adult was trying to unload their old 
        muscle cars for cheap after having their butts kicked by the insurance 
        industry and the OPEC oil embargo.&nbsp; As a 16 year old grocery clerk with 
        a steady income and still living with the Folks, I had managed to stash 
        away enough coin to pick up a big block '68 Camaro for $600.00!&nbsp; I 
        bought it from a guy named John Roberts who worked with me and&nbsp;was a 
        little older.&nbsp; He was my towns' version of John Milner&nbsp;of &quot;Graffiti&quot; 
        fame, and both he and that car already had reps as fast company before I 
        bought it.&nbsp; Yeah, it was &quot;the fastest car in the Valley, man.&quot; &nbsp;After he 
        sold me the&nbsp;Camaro, he proceeded to sink his money into another project, 
        a&nbsp;black and white '57 Shoebox that came to be known as &quot;The Skunk&quot;&nbsp;and 
        his brothers' orange, warmed over,&nbsp;340&nbsp;motivated '39 Plymouth Coupe. &nbsp;It 
        didn't take me long to understand why my newly purchased first 
        vehicle&nbsp;struck fear in people who went up against it.&nbsp; It scared the 
        crap out of me for nearly two weeks straight before I got used to its 
        power, the sound of the radical 3/4 cam, and the 8-track drowning Casler 
        Headers and Cherry Bombs providing the foot massage beneath the floor 
        boards.&nbsp; I nearly got my first ticket within the first 75 yards of 
        leaving Johns' house after picking up the title and the car.&nbsp; I applied 
        what I thought&nbsp; was up to that time a normal amount of pedal pressure to 
        get the car moving and out into the street only to have the meats break 
        loose right in front of a&nbsp;Cop who had just rounded the bend in front of 
        me.&nbsp; He slowed waaaay down and nearly turned around, but after a 
        pregnant moment, continued on his way.&nbsp; The last thing I&nbsp;needed was to 
        have that cars' profile raised even further among the local Constables 
        just as I bought it!&nbsp; Needless to say after I got used to it, and word 
        got around about my ownership, my popularity went up accordingly, and 
        all my buddies wanted to&nbsp;cruise with me on the weekends.&nbsp;&nbsp;A&nbsp;couple 
        succeeded in prying it out of my hands for a test drive while&nbsp;I crossed 
        my fingers in the shotgun seat or waited at the Pizza Hut while they 
        went around the block a couple of times.&nbsp; One guy, Ruben, came back 
        after I loaned it to him for an hour and a promise to put gas in it 
        proudly proclaiming: &quot;Hey Joe 'ol buddy, I hope you don't mind but I had 
        to defend your cars' reputation out there. This guy came up and wanted 
        to race me!&nbsp; Yeah, it was beautiful, I shut him down and he probably 
        wont be back&quot;... Forget about the car being a &quot;chick magnet&quot; though, 
        it&nbsp;was a little too scary for the&nbsp;well-heeled girls that were popular in 
        town.&nbsp;Header heat coming up through the tunnel, combined with occasional 
        fumes from the double pumper&nbsp;mounted on the Tarantula intake, which 
        stuck up&nbsp;under the fiberglass J.C. Whitney&nbsp;cowl&nbsp;hood. The whole 
        concoction of petroleum perfume wafting back into the car was a bit much 
        for the fairer sex, and it seems only my sisters thought it was tough 
        and cool.&nbsp;&nbsp;In retrospect, I just don't think there were enough 
        cool&nbsp;girls in my neighborhood anyhow.&nbsp; The car&nbsp;seemed to possess 
        anybody&nbsp;who drove it anyway, kind of like &quot;Christine&quot;, it didn't like 
        competition for it's attention.&nbsp;Street racing the thing was somewhat of 
        an exercise in ego stroking.&nbsp; I don't recall ever being shut down.&nbsp; The 
        closest race though was with my buddy Nick in his '71 LeMans which 
        sported a GTO front clip and a pirated '66 tri-power set-up from another 
        Goat.&nbsp; I beat him by a fender before we both had to slam on the 
        brakes&nbsp;to make a sharp left turn at the end of a road protected by a 
        high fence. &nbsp;A few years previous,&nbsp;a black '55 Chevy with Gasser 
        aspirations ended up spectacularly losing it in that same fence&nbsp;after a 
        similar street race with another local hot shoe in a 429 Galaxy 
        500.&nbsp;&nbsp;The end of the line &nbsp;for my ownership of the Camaro came just a 
        weekend short of shipping out to college in Albuquerque when it dumped 
        the timing chain and bent a couple of valves.&nbsp; With no time to rebuild 
        and no money anyway, I traded it straight across for a good running '68 
        GMC pickup which hauled me and all my gear to school the following 
        Monday...Rats! &nbsp;The mechanic I traded with promptly tore it down,&nbsp; fixed 
        it up, and with a little extra head work, took it to Missouri to race&nbsp;on 
        the Strip.&nbsp; He said it ran like a &quot;bat out of hell&quot; in the dense lower 
        altitudes&nbsp;until he blew it up for good a few months later while 
        approaching&nbsp;130 mph. Having to forfeit&nbsp;it in that way might have been a 
        blessing in disguise though, because I couldn't wait to take on&nbsp;the city 
        guys there in Albuquerque who had been racing for years on&nbsp;notorious 
        South Eubank Blvd., which was a&nbsp;long, straight dead end stretch of 
        road&nbsp;that ran back to Speedway Park.&nbsp;You could sit high in the stands at 
        Speedway Park on a Saturday night watching the Sprint Cars tear up the 
        oval&nbsp;(where the Unser Brothers started racing in the '50s) while also 
        looking just beyond the parking area to see crowds of people lining the 
        roadway as waves of hot rods lit off the line in manic heads-up street 
        racing before the cops would show up scattering everybody like 
        cockroaches.&nbsp;This kind of illegal hanky panky&nbsp;was tolerated by the 
        locals for a good 35 years before three street racing fatalities in the 
        late 80's finally shut the whole place down including the oval track 
        which was bulldozed to make way for&nbsp;a high tech computer chip factory.&nbsp; 
        As much as I loved that old Camaro and wish I had it back, sometimes I 
        think it might have killed me too.. I came close a couple of 
        times.&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps in The Almighty's grand scheme of things, blessings in 
        disguise&nbsp;might occasionally come in the form of bent valves...JK&nbsp;

          <b>Back in the late 60's and early 70's things were a lot different 
          for the young male, maybe not with the ladies, but definitely with 
          cars.&nbsp; Back then, anyone that had an intention to do so could borrow 
          the money, and purchase a muscle car for a really decent price.&nbsp; I 
          remember my friend Byrle buying a '68&nbsp;SS396 Chevelle, about 3 years 
          old with 28,000 miles, for around $2,800.&nbsp; It was a 396/375 horse, 4 
          speed, 4.10 gear, green with black buckets.&nbsp; With cars being 
          relatively plentiful, and Iowa having the most miles of paved roads 
          per capita in the US, there was plenty of street racing.&nbsp; (I remember 
          working for the DOT as a &quot;mechanic's helper&quot; at this time earning 
          $2.35 an hour).&nbsp; In spite of all these cool cars for cheap, the really 
          fast cars were usually what would be classified today as junkers, that 
          ran only upon occasion.&nbsp; While a relatively new muscle car was usually 
          somewhat dependable (Byrle did drop a valve in his 396 at about 40,000 
          miles, as a result of severe abuse, and I had to help&nbsp;him rebuild his 
          engine), a&nbsp;newer car meant car payments, insurance, and other costs 
          that might prevent a large investment in speed-producing parts.&nbsp;&nbsp;With 
          the very fast cars running so seldom, local racers would sometimes 
          take months to get to the point both cars would be running, and the 
          race would actually take place, and the bragging rights won.</b></div>
        <div>
          <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The best example of this was my friend Phil (now deceased) who 
          had a gold '56 Chevy 2 door.&nbsp; It had a 292 with the required &quot;fuelie&quot; 
          solid cam, AFB carb, headers, and a 4.56 gear that coined the phrase, 
          at least in Ames Iowa, that &quot;nothing helps as much as a gear&quot;.&nbsp; I 
          remembered Phil driving this point home to everyone at the local A&amp;W 
          one evening.&nbsp; He showed up&nbsp;at the drive-in after an absence of several 
          weeks proclaiming his car greatly transformed&nbsp;by the radically low 
          gear ratio, and willing to take on all competition.&nbsp; At least one 
          person took him up on it, and naturally, everyone ran to their cars to 
          go out to 13th street and watch.&nbsp; As was his habit leaving the 
          A&amp;W,&nbsp;Phil&nbsp; wound his motor to the moon before dumping the clutch to 
          burn around the corner onto Lincoln Way.&nbsp; However, the new gear 
          provided quite a bit more wheelspin that he was accustomed to.&nbsp; He 
          spun a complete 180, smashing soundly into a telephone pole.&nbsp; &quot;Wow!!&quot; 
          we all proclaimed,&nbsp; &quot;He had so much power he couldn't even control 
          it!&quot;&nbsp; Phil jumped from his mangled car, seemingly none the worse for 
          wear, and started running the half mile or so to his girlfriend's 
          house, much to the dismay of the Ames police, who quickly located him

          friend's cars challenging everyone to race his &quot;car at home&quot;.&nbsp; To this 
          day I have to laugh at Phil's ingenuity.&nbsp; It seems nobody wanted to 
          race his &quot;car at home&quot; because of the way it looked sitting in his 
          front yard.&nbsp; Huge ladder bars hung underneath near what appeared to be 
          huge exhaust collectors.&nbsp; A giant hood scoop looked as though it 
          covered a giant, supercharged motor, an exotic roll cage crisscrossed 
          the interior.&nbsp; At night, it looked to be a wicked street racer, but 
          during the day, when I went for a really close look, all the trick

          <b>Perhaps the most important skill a true street racer could learn, 
          especially in the early days, was the art of &quot;giving a ride&quot; to a 
          prospective candidate that might brag you up loudly at the next 
          bench-racing session.&nbsp; I remember Tony giving me a ride in his '69 
          Judge GTO.&nbsp; His technique involved a rolling start, nailing the 
          throttle (loved the Ram Air III torque!), then brutally powershifting, 
          while at the same time gently rocking the steering wheel back and 
          forth. This produced a truly out-of-control feel to the passenger, and 
          greatly&nbsp;increased the length of the smoking burnout.&nbsp; This was all 
          part of a ritual he had for picking up girls while scooping the loop 
          in downtown Des Moines.&nbsp; I think that a lot of the racing in those 
          days was for the benefit of the fairer sex who were drawn to the 
          street races.&nbsp; Anyway, If I was with him, Tony would drive around the 
          loop until he spotted his &quot;prey&quot;, two decent looking gals, by 
          themselves, also scoping the loop.&nbsp; After they made the turn 
          from&nbsp;Locust Street the 2nd Avenue (a nice, wide, 4-lane turn) he would 
          fall&nbsp;a couple hundred feet behind them and &quot;let it happen&quot; in first 
          and second gears, blazing by, sideways,&nbsp;in a cloud of tire smoke!&nbsp; 
          Then, crept slowly down Grand Avenue, waiting for them to catch up, 
          all the time rotating his head as in the movie &quot;The Exorcist&quot;, as 
          though he was looking to make sure &quot;the Man&quot; (cops) had not seen his 
          exhibition.&nbsp; As they passed (we were driving less than 10 MPH now) he 
          would yell out &quot;Got a cigarette?&quot;.&nbsp; By this time nine out of ten of 
          girls were&nbsp;grinning, searching&nbsp;their purses for smokes.&nbsp; The fact that 
          neither one of us smoked never seemed to reduce the effectiveness of 
          this ploy.&nbsp; I remember we lost two girls one night, after the 
          cigarette they threw us went into the ram air hood scoop, and Tony 
          stopped, and opened the hood to get it out.</b></div>

          <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've survived hundreds of these rides over my 55 years, but one 
          really stands out.&nbsp; My friend Gary, had recently finished an early 
          Jaguar 4 door, built to replace his red, '59 Corvette convertible.&nbsp; 
          With it's roman red paint, very loud 406 motor, (aluminum heads, 
          ridiculously radical solid roller cam, 250 horse nitrous kit) the 
          Corvette had been driven fast around town just a little too often for 
          the local police chief's liking, as well as other citizens within 
          earshot of our favorite test streets.&nbsp; This Corvette was the only car 
          I have ever been riding in where a neighborhood citizen actually 
          jumped into the street in front of it, in the suicidal attempt the 
          apprehend the&nbsp;crazed driver.&nbsp; Of course, Gary's theory was those so 
          offended by the Vet would certainly pay no attention to a stately, 4 
          door Jaguar.&nbsp;&nbsp;Naturally, the&nbsp;roller-cammed 406, TH400, a larger 
          nitrous kit, a sectioned 12 bolt Chevy rearend with a 4.11 gear were 
          installed into the Jaguar so it could still compete in nightly street 
          racing.&nbsp; Now don't get me wrong, Gary was the craziest driver, on the 
          street, I have ever ridden with, he scared my wife to death 
          just&nbsp;WATCHING him drive, while she was following in a car behind him, 
          but his plan for my &quot;ultimate&quot; ride took planning to a new level.</b></div>
        <div>
          <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had ridden in his Jag before that night, but never in the 
          dark.&nbsp; This took place&nbsp;a few months before the Jag was totaled by 
          snapping off a telephone pole on Lincoln Way, within the city limits, 
          about 20 feet ABOVE the ground, and sailing, Dukes of Hazard style, 
          several hundred feet into a cornfield. At the time, one of Gary's 
          favorite roads, Airport Road, was under construction.&nbsp; On Gary's 
          typical route, you&nbsp;could turn right, and go past where the guy jumped 
          out in front of him, or turn left on&nbsp;Airport Road, now closed but 
          preferable since the&nbsp;incident before.&nbsp; Well, at the time, they were 
          moving the road several hundred yards to the&nbsp;North.&nbsp; Progress on the 
          road had been slow, but they marked the end of the pavement with two 
          huge barricades, each about ten feet tall, and about ten feet wide, 
          painted with reflective white paint to prevent&nbsp;driver from going into 
          the rough, muddy field beyond.&nbsp; Right after the turn, Gary hit the 
          nitrous to make sure it was OK, then stopped.&nbsp; After my stern warning 
          that the road ended in about 1/4 mile, he took off.&nbsp; At midnight, 
          knowing the road ended soon, adrenaline of pure fear paralyzed me.&nbsp; In 
          an 11 second car, the tiny specs that were the barricades, grew at an 
          alarming rate.&nbsp; The sensation was that of a runaway locomotive, 
          my&nbsp;fear&nbsp;tripled the feel of acceleration. He was not going to stop!&nbsp; 
          My eyes were closed as we just barely fit between the barricades at 
          over 130 MPH, Gary was laughing&nbsp;hysterically.&nbsp; Unknown to me, the road 
          had just been finished about another 2 blocks past the barricades.&nbsp; 
          Thank&nbsp;The Almighty for the 4 wheel discs on the Jag, in the 'Vette, we 
          would have never got stopped. Gary said, &quot;I can't believe you didn't 
          scream!&quot; as a felt a slight, warm trickle down my leg, I have not 
          ridden with him again to this day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></div>

        on the PA side of the Delaware river in a 360 loop. Most of the locals 
        never used it. Well a couple of the boys knew what to do with it. As I 
        remember, it was 27 lengths of a group of clothes lines tied together to 
        equal 1/8 mile. A nice two foot thick stripe marked the spot. Then again 
        at the start and 1/4 mile marks. It was just a couple buckets of old 
        house paint we mixed together...lasted for over 30 years. Anyway, once 
        everything was set up by Suzie, we would meet at Scudder's Falls Bridge 
        Rd. at a set time. The road was not lit, so the spectators would line 
        the road for the entire quarter and light it with their headlights. Then 
        down would come an old 55 Chevy wagon with that faded green paint. Ramps 
        would come down and some nut case was already sitting in his B/Gas 
        dragster in his aluminum fire suit and helmet. A quick primer in the 
        Hilborn stacks a push start and up to the line. You could hear the bellyachers a mile away. LOL &quot;Run what ya brung&quot;. Drag racing the way it was...what 
        the hell is a bracket race anyway? Sounds like something you would find 
        in the shelving section of Ace Hardware. Anyway it paid for a good 
        portion of my first year at Trenton State College doing that. One of my 
        buddy out laws, ended up becoming the Chief of Police for that area. That's my story and I'm sticking to it.</b></p>

        the area. One night they were picking up some beers and these guys in a 
        rust old Chevy with snow tires and North Carolina plates were asking 
        about the RR and how fast it would go and did they want to race, how 
        about for money, pinks. Well the kid declined to race, but they were so 
        to side at the next stop light. The RR gets it on, the chevy passed the

        expect. I got out of it when I hit the crown of one direction, saw an

        one gas station and my one friend had a 440 GTX that was a dog! I use to 
        drive it for him cause he couldn't shift worth a darn. I talked him into 
        selling that thing and he used the money to buy his cousins stock but 
        real nice 67 6 cylinder 3 speed Nova. We put in a &quot;warmed&quot; over 327 out

        bars, Kustom (remember that name?) wheelwell headers, Holley 750 double

        it up 11 PM on a Saturday night at the station. It had open headers and 
        we where just going to try it out front for a quick run when all of the 
        sudden this Amherst cop car pulls up next to me! OH Shit I thought and I 
        quickly shut it off. The cop on the passenger side says to me what does 
        it have in it? I said a 327! He tells his partner and they grinned and 
        said lets go! They peeled out and I just sat there dumb founded! We did 
        have a cop friend on the force that used stray a little and race with us 
        but these guys weren't him! Anyways we raced for about 1 1/2 years that

        <td width="100%"><b>I was just starting to drive in the late 70's so I 
        don't have any street racing stories to share from back then, but I did 
        get involved in one incident (about '85 or so) that's worth telling.<br>
        The first &quot;neat&quot; car that I ever got was a '66 Vette roadster. Worked 
        two jobs and a lot of overtime to pay for it and then spent the next 
        year fixing it up. I kept it at my parent's house in West Paterson 
        (northern NJ). One Saturday afternoon I took it out for a short hop 
        around town to see if I had cured a carburetion problem that had been 
        dogging me all week. Dad was in the garage farting around when I pulled 
        out.<br>
        The Vette was running fine so I just figured I'd take it down the main 
        drag and head for home. I was sitting at the light and some kid in a 
        beat up late 70's Camaro pulled up next to me. The idea to race him up 
        the main drag never really occurred to me until the light went green and 
        he took off. My youth got the better of me and off I went, determined to 
        pass.<br>
        McBride Ave. in West Paterson is a string straight road for about 1/4 
        mile, and then it hooks hard to the right. Along the way you pass a 
        firehouse, stores, a school, etc...not the appropriate place for a drag 
        race on a Saturday afternoon. Didn't matter...I reeled him in and stayed 
        on his tail all the way up that street. We even pulled out over the line 
        to pass someone in our way...<br>
        About the time I passed the firehouse I knew it was over and I got on 
        the brakes-hard. You see, that right hook was coming up and I really 
        wasn't sure I could scrub off enough speed to make it. The Camaro didn't 
        slow down, and I remember thinking that he probably wasn't from around 
        here. Well, he did see the curve coming up but it was too late. He 
        locked up the wheels and proceeded to head off the curve, plowing into a 
        parked van right at the turn's apex. I was a bit luckier, and although I 
        got all crossed up I did manage to slide through the turn and get the 
        whole mess stopped a little past the wreck...angled across the road. 
        Kids must have guardian angels, because there were no cars coming the 
        other way, no pedestrians to get hit, etc.<br>
        I sat there, in the middle of the road for a few seconds thinking that 
        if that guy in the Camaro didn't make a move I would go over and 
        help...and suffer the consequences. That's when the door to the house on 
        the curve burst open and about 3 big guys came running out (the van's 
        owners, no doubt). Mr. Camaro also started getting out of his car, so I 
        figured it was time to get out of Dodge. First gear, sidestep the clutch 
        and I'm gone. It was only about a mile to home (West Pat. is a SMALL 
        town). I pulled it into the garage...Dad was still in there. In the 
        background I could hear sirens.&nbsp; &quot;How's it running, Son?&quot; &quot;Great, 
        Dad.&quot; he didn't see that I was sheet-white and my knees were knocking. I 
        went on the front porch to wait for the cops. Plenty of people had seen 
        me and in a town that small my car stuck out-everyone knew I had that 
        car.<br>
        The cops never came. The Vette stayed in the garage for a while, and the 
        whole thing taught me to be a little less foolish on the street. I have 
        occasionally strayed, but I'm much more discreet.<br>

        <td width="100%"><b>These street racing stories are bringing back 
        memories.<br>
        I didn't do much street racing but sure did a lot of hotrod driving.&nbsp; 
        I was raised by foster parents on a small farm in Georgia. Our Dad made 
        a living by selling vegetables to markets in the nearby towns.&nbsp; I 
        remember about 1969 he let me take some baskets of tomatoes to a store 
        about twenty miles away. I was seventeen at the time and this was my 
        first solo trip. We had a 55 Chevy, six-cylinder, three on the tree.&nbsp; 
        I was itching to try the car out since our Dad never got over 50 mph. I 
        had watched the neighborhood guys hotrodding and street racing on the 
        road in front of our farm for years so I was anxious to try my hand at 
        it.&nbsp; I had to drive slow to the store as not to damage the 
        tomatoes, but on the way home it was a different story. I didn't have 
        time to look at the speedometer, but I was nearly going airborne over 
        little hills. When I was about five miles from home I came up on a real 
        slow car. There was a straightaway ahead so I pulled the column shifter 
        down into low gear and went out around him. I had listened to the 
        hotrodders racing around home so I had learned what speed-shifting was. 
        So when I got wound out in first gear, I rammed the shifter up into 
        second gear without letting off the gas. I just about hit my nose on the 
        steering wheel when the transmission stayed in low gear. When that 
        happened I wasn't far enough ahead of the car I was passing to pull in 
        front of him so I slowly drifted back behind him. How embarrassing!! 
        From there I had to drive the car home in low gear as there were no 
        second and third. I stopped at two service stations to see if a mechanic 
        might have a quick fix but they said the transmission was broken on the 
        inside. I was scared to death to go home and face my Dad. I wasn't 
        accustomed to lying to him but it was in my best interest to this time. 
        I told him I didn't know what happened but it just wouldn't come out of 
        low gear. To my amazement he wasn't angry and said he had been 
        experiencing some problems with it lately. Bless his heart, he passed 
        away in 1996 and I never did tell him what happened that day. I now have 
        the 55 Chevy and am in the process of restoring it.<br>

        <td width="100%"><b>Byron; how 'bout the fifty's,,,<br>
        In Sept. of '56 ,my dad ordered a new '57 Chevy,<br>
        210 2 door hardtop (he was too cheap to buy a Bel Air ),<br>
        283 power pak,3 speed overdrive,4:11 rear end, turquoise &amp;<br>
        white, we drove it from Iowa to Calif. that x-mas to see relatives &amp; go 
        to the Rose Bowl game, even though I only had a learners permit, he let 
        me help drive ,on old route 66,,<br>
        in Feb. I got my license, he agreed to let me have the '57 on Wed. nites 
        for the car club meetings &amp; ONE nite on weekends for a date, Well, the 
        car club meetings lasted all of 15 min...just long enough to decide 
        where we were goin' to go race, one of the guys' dad was the local cop,&amp; 
        he would find out what side of town his dad was patrolling, so we would 
        race on the other side,,<br>
        The '57 was &quot;king&quot;,,I went several months as top dog,,<br>
        one of the guys' dad owned the local jewelry store, he was goin' to drop 
        outa hi-school, so his dad said he'd buy him any car he wanted ,if he'd 
        stay in school,<br>
        they went to Calif.,,L.A.,,when he got back, he had a '53 Olds &quot;rocket&quot; 
        88,,2 door ,light green w' a white top,,<br>
        didn't look like much, said they found it for sale at a gas station, out 
        there, then ,he lifted the hood, chrome valve covers, headers 
        (headers???shoot, most couldn't afford<br>
        Smittys mufflers) but, there on top, was 3 DUECES,, wow<br>
        I was blown away,,3 DUECES,, darn,,,on the firewall was<br>
        a small tag,, it said &quot; engine by MONDELLO &quot;,,hhmmm,<br>
        that musta been the gas jockeys name at the station ,,,I thought,,,( I 
        learned later who that Mondello dude was)<br>
        we paired off that next wed. nite, he got me a fender outa the hole, I'd 
        learned how to &quot;snap&quot; shift that column 3 speed, and that&#8217;s where we 
        stayed, I couldn't catch him, every wed. nite we paired off, every wed 
        nite he beat me by a little more, finally ,,by a whole car length, 
        anybody that wanted to race him, had to race me first, that was his 
        rule, nobody ever got to race him,,<br>
        in fall of '58,my dad traded the '57 for a new '59 4 door hardtop 
        Impala,,283 2 BARREL, powerglide,, I was sick, I begged him to let me 
        buy the '57,,but ,&quot;they gave me what I paid for it new ,$1900,&amp; it's got 
        102,000 miles on it &quot; he said,, &quot;besides. you can't afford it&quot;<br>
        When he was signing the papers on his new '59,,( the sales office was 
        above the service dept) he looked out the window, there was an 
        auctioneer &amp; a whole crowd of people surrounding his old '57,,&quot;What's 
        going on&quot;, my dad said, the sales mgr said &quot;why, we're auctioning off 
        your old car&quot; ,,&quot;why?,&quot; my dad said,,&quot;,don't you know?&quot;<br>
        he asked,, &quot;that's the second fastest car in town&quot;,,,,,<br>
        When my dad got home, I was in deep &quot;s**t,,&quot; you been racin' my car?&quot; he 
        said, no he &quot;HOLLERED&quot; ,,<br>
        well, I didn't get to drive the new '59 for 6 months, had to be happy w' 
        my '51 Ford daily school car,,,<br>

        O K ,,now a '70's story,<br>
        it was 1971,,I'd moved back to Iowa from Alaska in late '69,,bought a 
        new '69 SS 396 Chevelle(hugger orange W' a white stripe) up there &amp; 
        drove it down the Al-Can hi-way,,4000 miles to home,,\<br>
        I'd spent all afternoon that Sat. tuning' it up, Motion <br>
        top cat kit, plugs, timing at 42 degrees total, even a new set of TRW 
        valve springs,( without pullin' the heads,, Snap-On man sold me a trick 
        tool), so ,I was ready to go trawling fer<br>
        alligators( races), cruzed all the drive-ins,, was 'bout sick of fries &amp; 
        cokes,,, it was almost midnite,, figured I'd try one more place,, backed 
        in to a spot, (always backed in on the outside parking places),, the car 
        hop came out,<br>
        ordered a Vanilla Pepsi,, lit a Lucky Strike,&amp; waited,,<br>
        here came a Boss Mustang,, sounded good,, I could see the headers criss 
        crossin' under the oil pan,, MEAT,,,,<br>
        he saw me too,, backed in beside me,, got to talkin' &amp; he<br>
        was lookin' fer a race too,, Then a Road Runner came cruzin' in,,,he 
        backed in on the other side of the 'Stang<br>
        told the 'Stang how much of a piece a crap he had,, the 'Stang jumped on 
        it,, I said &quot; I'll race the winner&quot;,, so I<br>
        followed em out of town,, out on the &quot;Two Lane&quot; ,we were surrounded by 
        corn fields, ,no houses in site,, I flagged em off,,,the 'Stang got a 
        whole car length on the 'Runner , outa the hole,,then all hell broke 
        loose,,the 'Stang broke a motor mount &amp; busted the oil filter,,oil went 
        all over the place,,,helped him push the &quot;stang off on the shoulder,,the 
        &quot;Runner came back to collect his $50,,<br>
        I said O K ,,my turn,,so the 'Stang flagged us off,,<br>
        I pulled the 'Runner a fender off the line,,stayed there in 2nd,,pulled 
        another couple feet in 3 rd,&amp; walked him in 4th,,those Motion jets &amp; 
        metering rods really werked,,<br>
        not to mention the Mallory points &amp; TRW valve springs<br>
        got my $50 from the 'Runner,,he left,,kinda &quot;pissed&quot;<br>
        told the 'Stang we couldn't leave his car out there,or it<br>
        would get stripped ,,I got a tow strap outa the trunk &amp; towed him to the 
        nearest gas station,,,<br>
        the next Monday morn. ,at werk ( I was a service manager at a auto 
        center),,one of my mechanics came in,,&amp; shook my hand,,( he wasn't my 
        favorite,,he didn't like me,,he was a Ford guy &amp; didn't like Chevy 
        guys,,wouldn't do what I asked ,without a hassle,,ever since I hired him 
        outa Tech School),I asked what this was about,,he said &quot;Thanks&quot; that was 
        my best friend you towed in Sat nite,,,after that,he never questioned my<br>
        job assignments or my advice,,turned out to be my best guy,,,<br>

        <td width="100%"><b>Bill, At 18 years old in 71 I bought a 69 
        Chevelle,396, 3 speed in the floor. I lived at my mother's house at the 
        time. I was in love with that car, washed and shined on it every day. 
        About two months later I go to get in it and it's gone. Called the 
        police and they find it over the side of a bank somewhere up against a 
        tree. All they took was the carb. and the SS wheels. They pried the 
        trunk lid open and got the spare. It took the body shop and the 
        insurance co. about three months to get my car fixed.&nbsp; During that 
        time I got a new girl friend but I was sporting around in my mothers 
        extra car, a Corvair. Of coarse I was bragging to the girl friend about 
        my Chevelle. When they finally got it fixed my brother and I went and 
        got it and I took it to the freeway and opened it up. At about a 110, It 
        suddenly started slowing down and I just tried to push the gas peddle 
        through the floor. When it finally came to a stop The motor was locked 
        up. Off to the garage it went to be rebuilt. About two months later the 
        garage had it rebuilt and the mechanic told me to drive it real slow for 
        the first month so I headed straight for my girl friends house to show 
        her my car. She told me that her brothers had told her that they didn't 
        believe I had a Chevelle. About two weeks later I was driving home real 
        carefully and suddenly the engine made a crunching sound and locked up. 
        I towed the car back to the mechanic that rebuilt it and he tore it down 
        and said he had never seen anything like it. He said all the rod 
        bearings had stacked up on each other. He concluded that the rod 
        bearings were the wrong size for the crank. So about a month later the 
        Chevelle was fixed again and didn't give anymore trouble for a couple of 
        years. I bought a four speed and put in it and took it to the dragstrip. 
        It would run 14.70 in the quarter which was quick enough to make the 15 
        second break at our dragstrip. A couple races later I blew the engine 
        when I missed third gear during a time trial. A friend that had been 
        wanting to buy the car for a while jumped at the opportunity and offered 
        to trade me a 67 GTO even for it so I did. The GTO was in good shape. It 
        had a 400 cu in engine with an automatic trans. with a floor shifter. It 
        ran almost identical e.t. as the chevelle. I won my first drag race two 
        weeks later and have been drag racing ever since. I'm 50 years old now 
        and just about retired from racing but I still have my 66 Chevelle drag 
        car that I've had since 1981. <br>
